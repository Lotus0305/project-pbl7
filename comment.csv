1.75216E+16,4301288548,RatDotoKing,5,"This webnovel is an absolute masterpiece. I've spent thousands of hours reading webnovels, and I am pretty sure there's many on this website who've done the same. This goes out to those avid webnovel readers like me, I guarantee this novel is worth reading. I am gonna try and break down the novel into it's elements and explain why you should/shouldn't read this. PROS: 1. Regarding the characters: Characters are well fleshed out, even side characters. They actually seem like human beings with emotions, goals, interests. Also, there's no ridiculously dumb 2-dimensional filler characters/villains. Unlike other webnovels you can't read 2-3 lines about a character, and instantly tell whether they're common mob A, a villain whose just gonna be MC's ""stepping stone"", or some sidekick to unconditionally bend over for MC. Avid webnovel readers know what I am talking about. 2. Regarding the plot: The novel is dynamic, and intriguing because it's hard to guess what's gonna happen next, and there's an actual sense of tension for the reader. It's not one of those novels where the MC starts out against the weak villains and the strong villains only come out of the novel after MC has powered up enough to handle them. Plot twists in the novel actually make sense and aren't there just because the author thinks it's about time to throw in a plot twist. As far as I've read it's also great that there's no blatantly obvious plot holes. 3. Regarding the MC: The main character isn't cliche MC isn't an extremely talented supreme genius. He doesn't have an unbreakable will to move mountains. He doesn't have an unwavering heart of justice. MC isn't one of those you've insulted my petty pride so I am gonna murder your entire clan, kill all the women and children, raze the buildings, and kill the dog. Nor is MC one of those perfect do gooders that's gonna help every side character that's nice to him/he likes. He's not gonna be like ""You gave me an apple so I am gonna protect your family from the demon king and turn you into a super powerful fighter capable of destroying mountains."" MC is human. MC is relatable because you can imagine yourself being capable of doing/reacting the same way in those situations. MC is looking out for his own interest and trying to stay alive. He's training to grow stronger to survive, but his growth is reasonable and understandable. 4. Regarding world building: The world/environment the author depicts makes sense and isn't something unreasonable/unimaginable. In fact it makes more sense than common cultivation novel depictions of the world if cultivators existed. There's no walls of text describing the ungodly beauty of a garden/lake or how huge a mountain range that's only gonna appear once in the story is. Descriptions and world building are to the point, enough to let the reader learn more about the environment the MC, while not boring the reader. 5. Novel has humour and a bit of fan service in it: In my personal opinion I also like that the author balances humour and tension throughout the novel. Plot and tension is good, but the author also includes a bit of ""fun"" stuff for the reader to enjoy, MC doesn't stay a virgin just because he's a complete wimp. CONS/CON: As far as I know most of the people who didn't like/didn't continue reading the novel stopped because of how dark it can be at times. MC is coldblooded, and it may be off-putting to those used to reading novels where the MC is a champion of justice. MC here won't hesitate to use any means at his disposal to achieve his goals, ABSOLUTELY ANY, and I say that without the least bit of exaggeration. You're gonna read many novels about so called evil MCs, but the MC in this story makes many of them pale in comparison. In Conclusion/TLDR: If you took the time to read all that/skipped everything and are wondering whether to read it or not, read the first 40 chapters. You're almost certain to get hooked.",838984679
1.75216E+16,4316124769,BigManGuts,3,"This is the first WN I’ve read on this app and I’ve read around 50 other WN’s inbetween this WN and the review (I used other sites to read WN’s until I actually made an account), so my memory might be a bit hazy in terms of story development and world background. Writing Quality: 3.7/5 If I was the author I’d use a broader range of vocabulary, be more descriptive (quantity), and just have a detailed description (quality) if things like the surroundings, fights, etc. Writing Stability: 5/5 Not much to say here, 7-8 chapters a week consistently which is very good imo. Story Development: 3.2/5 Some plot holes here and there but nothing too major to the point where it’s detrimental to the story. It’s still too early to comment on this since this WN feels like it’ll easily be over 1000 chapters. I just hope the pace doesnt skyrocket out of nowhere and just becomes like your average cultivation novel right before the typical “holy continent” arc. Character Design: 3.5/5 It’s an odd mix of some characters are bland, some have an alright design, and some feel like actual humans. The MC has some dumb things about his personality like being overly paranoid of the system and his sponser. This category was originally going to be a 2.5/5, but after reading the recent chapters it looks like the huge main female cast might finally be getting some character development, so I decided to bump it to a 3.5/5. World Background: 3/5 From what I’ve read so far this has the potential to be a 5/5 if the author plans ahead carefully and doesn’t rush the rest of the story. In general, we haven’t been told that much about the world and beyond it, but it’s clear that the author has plans to talk about everything more in depth later on in the story. This is my completely objective review so even though i gave it an overall rating of 3.6/5 that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t entertaining or that i didn’t enjoy it. When VC reaches the 550 chapter mark I’ll update this review and make it way more detailed and in-depth, but until then the review stays as is. I hope everyone that reads this has a good day, cya💯",838984941
1.75216E+16,4300007542,DamnPlotArmor,5,"Due to the recent toxic comment(s) from a handful of readers (or an alt from a hater), it has come to me that some readers might have misunderstood the concept of this novel. Therefore, I'm putting this review as a disclaimer, so these readers who are expecting a certain type of MC or a type of story can understand what they are getting into. And then, when they start flaming, I can just remind them of their ignorance. What you will NOT see in this novel. 1. Fast-paced story 2. OP MC at the beginning of the story 3. Unyielding MC that refuses to bow down to anyone. 4. An evil MC that violates laws and order at the early story. 5. A Mary Sue, Gary Stu, Kirito-like MC that infinitely gains instant powerup without having to work hard. 6. An alpha MC that has a perfect personality and makes perfect decisions in every action. 7. A ruthless, reckless, and brainless MC that goes around and provoke everyone left and right because of a trivial matter. 8. Humorless dark story. What you will SEE in this novel. 1. Slow-paced story. 2. An MC that understands these words and can put them into practice; ""Compromise"", ""Tactical Retreat"", ""Surrender"", ""Mutual Interest and Benefit"", and ""Politics"" 3. MC with a brain, but it fails to function properly sometimes, especially when his dick takes over. 4. MC NTRing other protagonists. 5. Plot twists. 6. Hard-working but mental MC 7. A semi-useless system, but it forces MC to work hard. 8. Toned down mature scenes. 9. Memes and Jojo References 10. THOTS, Mind-Breaking, Mind-Controlling, HAREMS. 11. Weak-to-Strong MC 12. Moderately Stupid-to-Military Genius MC 13. VILLAIN =/= EVIL 14. Protagonist =/= GOOD I hope this would clarify the tone of this story. I'll edit this when there are changes. In summary, to those readers that motherf-ckingly claimed that they are here looking for an evil mc and got disappointed when they found a mature MC with a politic face, they can just F off. Now, I've warned you. You can roast me with your almighty insights, my dear trolls. I welcome all constructive criticisms that points out my mistakes, flaws, inconsistency, and advice on what I can do better. But personal attacks, toxic comments, and flaming will be instantly deleted.",868245777
1.75216E+16,4313251734,Z3R0_S1L3NCE,1,"I truly did not like this and simply couldn't read past chapter 14. I felt as if i would simply die of frustration because of everything that was happening in the novel and the reasons behind it. The author aswell as other 'reviewers' have tried to make excusesfortheplain lack of logic and common sense, but with an mc who changes personality, has a naive trust for strangers from an entirely different planet that happen to remind him of those cultivation novel he read, previously confirmed by his 'system' (master)and makes unique life decisions considering he has 'read novels like this before', marries a girl because he feels sorry that he has no choice but to take her virginity, forced into situations by his useless system that incurs the death penalty for evry failure. The fact that a 60 year old former mma champion, a man who occasionally reads webnovels, predictably gets pushed around by trouble he has invited into his radar, being called a slave because of his haircut and not doing anything about it not five chapters later and not even having a stray thought about freeing himself.",868246450
1.75216E+16,4300163965,Bored_Monster,3,"Read until chapter 18 and from what I can see, MC, despite having lived till 60, acts like a brash 20 year old with severe anger issues. Granted he transmigrated (which he accepts way too easily considering he had a family) and was then taken advantage of, called a slave and then sent to a lion's den(op brothel). But what broke the I can still read this was how, through the use of a system skill, he brought the madam (not actually her, basically a puppet) of the brothel (sect) that he is now a part of and who 'adopted' him and says, Hahaha I don't believe I can't defeat(push you down, rape basically) you when you're at 1%(power) then proceeds to lose (die) 99 times then says that was idiotic, wasting all that precious training time. I agree that was idiotic and way too forced. Also first girl he f*cked, brothel girl, who he felt bad for so he says you'll be my wife and tells her he loves her after f*cking, with what I saw he doesn't have sympathy or compassion, so was the *** that good?",868244562

1.75216E+16,4306596376,kcorny,5,"Read through 50 Chapters in 2 days. It's really good, maybe wait for more chapters to accumulate tho? Basic Transmigration, but instead of an OP MC we get OP Sidecharacter who is railroaded by the system into fighting all those protagonists and antagonists from the novels we know and hate. Dude just wants to chill out and sleep with all the females, but other people have plans for him, so he is forced to become stronger while trying to survive/keep true to himself. One important thing about this is: The MC is smart. As in. Thinks ahead, never let's a clue unchecked, gathers information type thing. First 5-10 chapters are painful because he is still adapting to a new world and getting his bearings, but from then on this is a really good read.

The MCs backstory is actually good and him being older in his previous life is a plus for me. The main problem I have is the sloppy plot progression as the MC is led around by his nose by all the charecters around him and seems to be thrown around left and right the minute he gets sent into the world. The other main problem I have is how shallow and poor the charecter development is of the MC as he is supposed to be a 60 year old man previously and have experience with xianxia novel and still falls face first into every cliche he possibly could. As of chapter 13, I cant see this story making enough changes for me to change my recommendation of not recommending this novel to other readers.",868244562

1.75216E+16,4300834559,Crazy_Cronie_1,4,"heyo crazy cronie here, review on 27/01/2021 @chap170 review divided in: Short review Long review Ratings Conclusion short review: You want a villain mc? this is the novel you are searching for... long review: pros: 1) I just love action scenes. I am someone who skims thru action scenes in most of the novels... But here I read most of the action scenes. Author kept it short and easy to understand scenes. 2) In most of the novels by now people would be clear about the ""world"". But here author kept the mystery building but at the same time explains slowly about the world and just doesn't dump info. Everything here makes sense and nothing is ""illogical"" as of now... 3) author walks the talk!! The story is exactly what synopsis said unlike other novels where story changes after 100-200 chaps. 4) characters all feel real.. the side characters, the ""villains"", they all have their own personalities, own emotions, own goals. Even after brainwashing they retain their innate personalities, not just become what mc wants... 5) mc isn't perfect/genius. Even if he plans not everything goes how he wants. 6) cons: 1) [NOT REALLY A CONS] for all those who came for R-18 scenes, just don't bother to read this novel... Infact R-18 scenes suck 2) [NOT REALLY A CONS] mc bears children which I really hate it... I personally don't like novels where mc has children...but this is just personal opinion so ignore it... 3) [NOT REALLY A CONS] the starting 10-15 chapters people might hate it since mc doesn't ""act like his age"", they might hate coz of his bad luck, but they forget he just arrived from modern world so it'll take time before he settles himself and author really did it well in later chapters 4) this really is not a ""comedy"" as the tags were mentioned... Rather ""parody"" tag might be better option RATINGS: writing: 9/10 update: 9/10 plot: 10/10 characters: 9/10 pacing: 9/10 dialogues: 9/10 entertainment: 10/10 OVERALL: 4.6/5 Conclusion: Don't bother with the guys who reviewed after reading 25-30 chapters... Read 40 chapters and most of you might just get addicted....",868244698

But then it starts to fall off, pretty much levels dont matter to the mc, from the first fight to the boss fight. after a little while its explained how his attributes are higher than normal for his level and his 120 rating further increases the effects? But lets talk about the spider, an arrow blows off half the bosses face ‘ok a consumable whatever’ he uses a spear and controls it to spin inside the boss monster’s body getting “super critical hits” Okay he wins bc he used environment but then how about the Mythic boss which he shouldve died just being near the fight and he causes the boss to be weary of what a lvl 15 when the boss and players are so high he cant even see their levels. he uses his ultra big brain from being there a little bit to figure out the lightning patterns that the guilds who studied to fight the boss didnt even notice and uses the environment to electrocute the boss and his sword to cut and kill this super high ranked mythic boss and proceed to demolish and intimidate the high ranking players and then escape? Cant continue reading because game mechanics dont apply here and the stat page is meaningless. I enjoy the background building but inside the game i just cant anymore.",1136075647

Less than ten characters have appeared so far, but I feel that this is going to be the kind of story without many 2D characters, but with more 3D characters and not so cartoonish. I could feel it through the dialogues and the way the characters express themselves in some situations. Of course, I can't stop talking about the protagonist, who for me is one of the highlights of the story so far. He is ironic, serious, intelligent, mischievous and, above all, a great character. Thanks to all this, this story deserves 5 stars (and my first review).",1133571263

It’s been a while since a video game novel has been this good imo At first interactions feel a bit empty and the language doesn’t flow well, but it’s drastically improved over time. There are still some “he/she” mixups though. The story and world are all very good. The plot progresses nicely along the main character and everyone feels real. There are some things that don’t make sense like the MC’s ability to fight things stronger than him. Even if he has extra stats per level, some of these enemies with their level would one shot home before he could blink, so it feels like the MC wins for no reason sometimes but it’s entertaining regardless.",1133571238

And as this mc is so old it means he is very experienced. Meaning he's not some gullible, *****, mc. Right off the back that's a big plus for me. Now I dont wanna give any spoilers but I like the way a old grandpa was introduced to the game and picked up crafting of all things.

1.32254E+16,4300423322,Fiaran,3,"I have been mostly enjoying the story. I have quite an ability to suspend disbelief and just go along with the flow of a story. I like the characters, the backstories and families. But the writing is killing me. Since I started reading web novels, I have gradually acquired the ability to ignore typos and poor grammar to a large extent, but since stories magically turn into three-dimensional movies or holograms in my head, I have great difficulty with behavior of characters that seems preposterous or caricaturish (if that is a word.) They kick me out of my 3D movie and remind me that this is just words. The main character laughs and chuckles every second time he opens his mouth, frequently described as ""lowly""."" To quote Inigo Montoya, ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."" Lowly = of humble or base birth. It has nothing to do with sound volume. Also people sigh, loudly, frequently. In real life people sigh because they are frustrated, disappointed, depressed or really tired, and it's considered rude or a comment. One character laughs then sighs two seconds later. Another sighs, chuckling. Try doing that. It's not possible. The worst one is the use of the word ""softly"" with just about every smile in the first 20 chapters. Softly implies intimacy. Smiling softly is something you would do during a touching moment with a loved one, or while looking down at your newborn baby. It's not something a stranger does to someone they meet the first time for an interview. Reading the softly smiling over and over again gave me the creeps, like I'm reading about a serial killer softly smiling at the knife he just used to slice the throat of his latest victim, or fondling the organ he removed as a trophy. Yuck!!!! Author, please learn the many different types of smiles, and that the only time people laugh so much when they interact with others is when they're nervous, flirting, or are Santa Claus, paid to say ho ho ho. If you could remove the strange emoting the characters are doing, I'm sure I could spend most of my time enjoying my 3D movie of your story. I suggest you do some people watching. For instance, you don't talk about hand gestures at all. A lot of people talk with their hands. They also fiddle with their hair, and touch things and people around them. You also don't mention body language at all. I don't mean that you have to add all of those at the same time, just sprinkling in a little of all of them at different times brings characters to life.",844417037

1.32254E+16,4153706117,Obsidion,3,"I really wanted to like this novel... Novels about blacksmithing are my favorite. But i couldn't, i had to stop at chapter 17... The crafting chapters are perfect, it shows that the author cared and researched a lot about it. But the character interactions are so stupid and irrational that makes my head hurt. I really try to ignore all of that but omg i can't. Some situations are so stupid and forced that feel this story is written by a kid. I meant no disrespect, but this had to be said..",844416936
1.32254E+16,4302088397,Zelinker,2,"I've read up to chapter 400 so far and I would say this story is ok at best. The author goes into a lot of detail with describing the things the MC is doing while crafting, which at the start I thought was good and even necessary to sort of lay the foundation and give the reader a better understanding of what was happening, as well as visualize the crating process. What I didn't like is that the author continues to write about crafting in great detail like this for the rest of the story. Now there's nothing wrong with the crafting aspects in these kind of stories, in fact I enjoy the crafting parts a lot. The problem is there is not enough action/adventure or story development taking place to balance out the crafting aspect and it gets tiresome to read. The beginning of the story was decent as the MC first enters the game prior to its official release and reaches his first town where he begins crafting in the various styles like smithing, leather working, tailoring, alchemy etc. This goes on for a few dozen chapters, and just when it's starting to get boring, the MC leaves the first town and starts traveling. Then the story picks up a bit and gets more interesting for a little while, until the MC goes to sea to reach some islands. At this point the pacing of the story takes a dramatic plunge and is almost completely focused on crafting during the voyage with only a few plot developments for about 150 chapters, and became painful to read. After the MC finally reaches the islands the story starts gets interesting again for a little while, before falling right back into monotonous crafting. As for the MC's life irl, most of it I found boring, unnecessary, and during one part, even offensive. I was holding out, hoping the story would get better after other players started entering the game, but by chapter 400 the game hasn't even been opened to the public yet, and I'm probably going to drop this. For some, this might be a good story, but it just didn't suit my tastes. If you're looking for a good story with the right balance of action/adventure, story development, and crafting, I would highly suggest reading ""Overgeared"" instead of this.",844416980
1.32254E+16,4304764907,The_Good_Devil,3,"ok. honest review here: the story is absolutely unique and interesting specially the part of the wise old man as the main character. But unfortunately it has some problems. it may not be problem, more like not my cup of tea. the story is lacking in terms of action and adventure. the first 20 chapter is all about pure craftsmanship and after some time it became boring. I mean it's good to learn about new thing. but when sewing a dress take a few chapters for the job to be done and most of the information about the process of creating the dress is forgeted by most readers and has no point in the future plot-development then the chapters will become with no purpose and you can skip them. anyway if you are that type of person who enjoys the calm novels without any cliffhanger then this is good novel for you.",844416699
1.32254E+16,4307693921,Fortigan,4,"Some advice for the Author. Please note that this is meant as constructive criticism, not complaining, as I love the story. You really need to get an English Thesaurus to broaden your vocabulary and help find more appropriate descriptive words. I know others have spoken to you about ""lowly"" being used improperly already (should word swap every instance of ""lowly"" with ""softly""), but some other words are really out of place as well. For example; ""nodding furiously in agreement"". Furiously is a word normally used to describe a degree of anger. It ""can"" be used to describe intensity, but ""nodding furiously"" will throw off your readers because it implies anger (check the definition of the root word ""fury"" to better understand why). There are several other words that would better describe the visual you were intending, such as ""vigorously"", ""energetically"", ""excitedly"", or ""swiftly"". Another issue I've found is when you add ""ity"" to the end of a word instead of ""ness"". For example; ""genuinity"" is not a word, but ""genuineness"" is. Likewise ""nervosity"" is not a word, but ""nervousness"" is. Lastly, you occasionally use the word ""light"" incorrectly, and should use ""slight"" instead. For example; ""light grin"" should be ""slight grin"". Light in this situation is used to describe a form of measurement, but not degree of something. Such as volume or weight, but not a degree of intensity. In this case a ""slight grin"" would mean a partial grin or a grin to a lesser degree. To be honest, English is a very dumb language that breaks it's own rules a lot when it comes to proper grammar. You can't rely on word definitions alone to fully grasp English grammar either, so I would highly recommend seeking out a native English speaking editor to assist you in this area. All that being said, I absolutely love your story. You have a lot of creative talent and I greatly appreciate the work you have put into this novel. I'm a freelance editor and if I had the spare time right now I would offer my services to you. Perhaps at a later date I might be able to assist if you are interested and still lack an editor.",844416866
1.32254E+16,4310365859,Wolf9,3,"I've dropped this novel at the point when they are building the boat. I won't talk about the good parts of the story as they have been mentioned in many reviews, but only what i didn't like about it. First thing i didn't t like is the MC. His actions and they way he plays don't feel to me like an old mans at his 60s-70s, bases on how seriously he acts and plays the game. Secondly, the pacing of the story is bad. On the one hand, the story doesnt stay stagnant and things do happen, wether its crafting, fighting or interacting with people in the game(npcs or players). On the other hand, its ~200 chapters and the GAME is not even open for the public, and from some other review its not at ~400 chapters either. Lastly, i don't like the game you created. For me multiplayer games comes hand to hand with competition, whether thats pvp or getting a first clear on a dungeon. And your game destroys any chance of competition the further it goes. You have players with literally months of advantage before the game opens, 5 of them that are destined to be the best of the 5 elements of the game from the very start and then you get all 5 of them together to form a guild. How is anyone gonna compete with that? Moreover, the ""slots"" for the main questline are filled before even the game goes live. The first plotline has to do about the war of two sides if dragons through their champions and 2 of the ""good"" ones have already been picked by chapter 200. What made me drop the novel was that lack of fairness and chance for the general player to compete for any kind of lead in the game.",844416655

1.97609E+16,4300994361,Demonic_angel,5,"Author Review! Alright, after 21 days of this book release and seeing the reactions, I think I am finally ready to review my book. So here it goes: Story Development: It's a Story about a boy who was thought to be powerless in a world where a lot of people awakened with various abilities. Pretty standard, right? But that's when things changed. Seeing that he was useless, they used him for their experiments to test how much pain a human body could bear. Unfortunately, this test didn't stop before he died. His body was tossed away only for him to Awaken finally, not with one ability but with many more. The kid who was thought to be a useless human was someone who was out for revenge. At its core, it seems like a revenge story, but it spreads out in many exciting directions, which I'm sure some of you will like. It's also a villain vs. heroes story where good variants and MC are on the opposite side. World Background: It's a story set in a modern world It'll be a profound and interconnected world. It's a world where Dungeons exist, but monsters can't come out of the dungeons. They can only come out when certain conditions are met. And to make sure that doesn't happen, there are various Organizations. It's also a world where people Awaken with power, so there are crimes involving them, and there are also heroes who stop them and catch the Dark Variants. The world will also involve many more things. I don't think any amount of words can explain it here. So please read. Character Design: I'm trying to make the characters unique, but you shall be the judge of that. I can't comment on this. Update Stability: Daily updates with bonus chapters every Monday or Tuesday. So 5 star :p Writing Quality: I try not to make any errors, but where there's a human, there will be errors, so please forgive me if you see one or two mistakes once in a while. Last Words: I'm sure if you come with an open mind to enjoy a story, you'll like it. It's a pretty interesting story, and it gets even better later. PS: Some people say the story gets a bit dark on occasions, so... reader's warned if they don't like that? But I don't feel like it's too dark, so please be the judge of that. (´；ω；｀) Have a great day, thanks for going through such a long review Yours Obediently, Demo- Oh god, why am I writing it like a letter now?

1.97609E+16,4318152439,Retr09007,2,The author already started to drag fights out by chapter 33 when the mc could have ended it easily. Everyone except the mc is evil and hates little kids. The people that are evil arent even logically evil. They just hate the mc for no reason. The first reaction we saw in the story was people wanting to literally beat him up because he was a 10 year old orphan and no one even tried to stop them. All of the worldbuilding is done through conversations which leads to random side characters talking way too much about information that isnt relevant for the current situation at that part in the story. There is also the extreme edge coming out of the mc that comes off as cringe instead of cool.,857912492

The MC was deemed useless because his powers didn't awaken, mistreated and then he would rise like a phoenix and teach those people a bitter lesson. Kind of reminds me of Battle Through The Heavens. This trope is very popular and never tiring to read for a reason. But, even though the premise is a bit cliche, I have faith in the amazing author to mix the story with his own recipe and make it special, just like his other books. For one, he already spiced up the story by making his MC a villain. Can't wait to see more characters fleshed out so we get to see the 'heroes' too. The pace is perfect, not too slow nor too fast. In three chapters you already get the solid foundation for the story. Give it a read now now now!",857912535
1.97609E+16,4311833031,Trent_4485,2,"Not a very unique idea, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you make it unique through good character and plot development, but the 'protagonist' is simply bad...I don't have another word to describe it. The story starts off by giving a reasonable explanation for how the 'protagonist' ends up the way he is, and his abilities are fun to follow along with, but as I read, I just find that I hate the main character more and more. He is a 10 year old child that didn't have guidance and ended up psychotic, which is something that can reasonably happen, but its simply an unpleasant read because of his awful personality and characteristics. Having a main character that just goes around killing people is simply not appealing to me. perhaps he gets redemption later on where I have not read, but I already quite dislike him as a character and all in all it has got me bored enough to stop reading. I'm sure some people would enjoy having an irredeemable main character like this, but I dont. Usually when I enjoy a story with a main character such as this, there are other aspects that make it worth reading like comedy or uniqueness, but this doesn't seem to show signs of such yet. Again, I'm sure this kind of story is appealing to some people but I personally do not reccomend.",857912738

With that being said, the story dragged on in some parts, the author constantly promises daily updates but does not update, the author takes up space by repeating 3-4 paragraphs at a time in new chapters, is ridiculously repetitive with the same small details, and at this time I’m pretty disappointed that i spent money on this book. There are so many typos and errors that it is sometimes hard to read, the “editor” does not edit very well. I know this may sound harsh, but it is my honest review.

I mean you could be doing ANYTHING productive, but u can read this too. Ok, reasons: pairing up bro and sis? Ok, not blood related, but we’re grown up like them till his 18th bday. When parents are the ones pushing them together? No thanks. 2000 hrs in future, humans went galactic. And Chinese brought the cultural baggage with them all the way?

Oh yeah I don't know if this the translator or the author but the grammar needs some work. So basically this novel is a funny and can be light-hearted, the fights are not that interesting from time to time and at least a little bit of interest in the Universe , humans aren't at the bottom of the food chains and not at the top. There is no silly young master that wants to kill him because of a lost or something like I said before the author's making jokes about the stereotypes and the grammar can be kind of confusing from time that time. The MC is likeble but not too great and I to stupid, he acts like an actual person like one of us that found them self transmigrated into another world, his interaction with other characters art funny and interesting.

The space is just a little space equivalent to the size of an RV. It has electricity to run various electrical items but has no internet. The goods and food stored in it can not do a ”refill” once consumed. The FL Bai Wutong can fight but is not really a fighter like Qing Feng, the dark guard. Even if she came from the Apocalypse era, she can only fight the zombies and has no superpower (so far. I’m curious why?🤔) The ML Chu Tianbao, has an amnesia at the start. He regressed to a childlike-way of thinking but maintained his powerful martial arts. He called the FL “Mother” then changed it to “Wife” upon Wutong’s insistence. Stinky, the little cutie, a 6-month old baby with his guard Lin Yue mixed into their group and became their son. Hahaha!!! It was amusing reading the scenes where Tianbao and Stinky bicker and communicate with each other. “Ah Pu… Ah Pu”…. Then Daddy Tianbao would translate for him to others.😈 So far they are escaping Beiyan City while besieged by Wang Qiong. So the last 3 chapters showed the first twist I. This story.

1.67092E+16,4311277116,Adui,5,"So it has been five months since I began writing this novel, and here is an updated review answering some of the many questions I come across. Of course, first and foremost is the story itself: Noah Osmont is an average guy in his 20s with no superhuman brain or genius-level IQ, and he receives the gift of Infinite Mana in a world facing an apocalypse, a world that is filled with Dungeons that routinely need to be cleared or they will explode with monsters. He learns more about his gift as he starts off his adventure as a Hunter, much of his time filled with blood-pumping battles as he spams spectacular Skills on unsuspecting Dungeon Bosses. This adventure continues as he becomes stronger, learns to become smarter, and uncovers the mystery behind his Infinite Mana, as well as get tangled with the major powers of his world. This fast-paced adventure quickly moves forward as even more mysteries are unraveled- Who initiated the apocalypse on their world? How many more worlds are out there facing the same thing? Why exactly are Emperor Penguins so arrogant? Which world's cuisine is actually the best? The adventure will be long and exciting, with an ending nowhere in sight as we uncover more mysteries about the worlds around us, and the Ancient Powers that move behind the scenes... Q- Will there be a harem? A-Well, yes, a mini harem at most, with only two or at maximum three Female Leads. Q- Will the MC actually get smarter? Yes- He's a normal guy learning about everything firsthand and trying to improve, not a Webnovel reader equipped with immense knowledge of what can and should happen in the future of a story, and the exact correct ways to react to it. He will eventually become more pragmatic and careful as ruthlessness slowly see** in, without him becoming a cold-blooded murderer. Q- Just how OP will the MC become? A- Very. There is no limit to OPness Q- Anything else I should know before I start binging? A- It's a fast-paced novel with no heaven rending beauties described for an entire chapter, filled with action and powerful Skills and Abilities that only expand as time goes. Enjoy the ride, and a big thank you goes towards the readers who have supported and enjoyed the novel all this time ^.^",1001083717

1.67092E+16,4306339980,cip44,5,"This is one of the best books I have read in the genre Fast paced, but without really losing out charater development. The story and world-building are excellent, though world-building is a bit limited for reasons which will become apparent in the story. One of the book’s strength is that it heavily relies on your knowledge of various myths or tropes in order to ‘color in’ the world, but you can easily and blissfully ignore that and just go with the story. The MC is definitely OP, but again, the enemies he has certainly make him work for whatever he accomplishes. Highly recommended :-)",1001082973
1.67092E+16,4310389001,Yveleti,1,"I have several things I want to highlight in this review before it gets taken down by the author, like most of my reviews that are pure and utter fact. This novel is a carbon Walmart knockoff of the KR novel “I have infinite mana” however, due to the fact that I greatly enjoyed the Korean novel, I decided to give this a go. I was sorely disappointed by the author this time around, and have completely dropped this garbage novel. There are many things wrong with it that simply become unbearable the more you read. First of all, the main character is completely and utterly moronic. MC has been clearing dungeons like he’s taking a walk in the park and he’s in complete shock when he gets found out. This doesn’t track obviously, because if a official finds someone clearing dungeons easily and has only been a hunter for 2 days they are bound to investigate. Secondly, there are a astronomical amount of errors and grammar mistakes that my brain is starting to turn into slush from the amount of garbage the author has decided to include. My conclusion is that this story only gets a high rating because the author deletes negative reviews like this one, to maintain a high rating and trick people into reading this garbage trash heap. Don’t read this garbage if you value your own intelligence.",1001082951

The main character is a complete waste of word. He is the stupidest character you have ever seen and will ever see! Like seriously, if you were to animate a brick, it would make better life decisions than the MC can ever hope make. He plans to lay low but goes to clear dungeons within minutes in broad daylight. He think he is weak but instead of improving himself he sells all of the stuff that can make him stronger for money. Basically think of the most logical way to solve a problem, and then do the exact opposite. That how our MC fares. He is a spit to the face and a kick to the ass for readers(you will also get charged for it). If you can turn off your logical brain, then you can enjoy this one quite well, as the idea of it is quite interesting.",1001083740

Sure, he did some research, but the right information is expensive - and only VIP can afford that.

If the lowest tier orb gives 50 strength or some bs like that, why was the giant's strength a B-rank skill if low tier orbs drop like pinecones from a pine tree? Also, the infinite focus o is total bull shît, and really doesn't work. I would understand if the mc had a ability that multiplies his focus by 10, 100 even, but infinite is too much. The mc went from 1-100 since the first chapter, and there really isn't any character development. The mc is a fücking coward and really dumb. Why would he sell skill books because they wasn't suiting the type of build he was doing? For example, the golem summon spell was just sold without an explantion. He isn't unkillable, and if a speed class rushes him while everything was down, he ded. The golem provides ample protection even when he disables the barrier, and will also stall the boss for him. Why did he use the giants strength skill book and sold the ice spikes? That giant strength book is the one that doesn't match your build, and who tf makes a 'build' in a apocaplyse setting?

In fact, I bet that many 12-year-olds would do a better job. The beginning and the premise are completely copied from a Korean novel with a similar name. The main character is one-dimensional while the side characters are ZERO-dimensional. This story and system are so simple that even someone with a 70 IQ would understand it easily. There are plot holes starting from the first chapter. There the MC said something like ""I hope that I'll awaken a useful ability""... But in fact, in this world, there are no abilities to awaken, lol. If you aren't facepalming at most of his decisions then let me congratulate you - you've passed this IQ test with 80 points! Yay! So why is this popular? I think that this story, Vampire System, and Cultivation Online show you what you need to succeed at Webnovel. Op protagonist, a fast pace so that he could show off how OP he is, fast release rate so that people could get addicted to your story. That's it.

Not here, the cultivation civilization is very advanced and even low-level cultivators can battle cultivators 1-2 stages higher. Now, most people will say that the story is slow, and it might indeed appear so. In my opinion, the story is more centered around world building most of the time, so the progress is quite slow.

I've read over 2000 chapters of the crude machine translations, and this is still my favorite webnovel, despite the bad grammar. It beats out anything else I've ever read. Not only is it the biggest game of Xanatos Gambit Speed Chess I've ever seen, it does it in a world that combines classic Chinese mysticism and modern technology in an absolutely astounding manner. This story is the epitome of magitech in xianxia. For heaven's sake, give this a read. Li Yao's crazy adventures will have you sweating through your shirt and dancing around your room shadowboxing, as he comes out of grave situation after grave situation on top every time thanks to sheer stubbornness, luck, and an awesome amount of guile. The story doesn't get old with age, either. Even when Li Yao becomes a ""Nascent Soul Old Monster"", there are still fresh challenges and heart's demons to be conquered. The author has done a fantastic job deconstructing and subverting all the classic wuxia tropes, and more to the point, it's a profound lesson in philosophy that will have you struggling to refute the logic of the enemies - that is, until Li Yao refutes them himself. I can only sing the praises of this story so much. Let me leave you with this. Once this story is fully translated, it will probably be my #1 favorite xianxia novel for ever.

If you cba to read the whole review, then I will simply say that this is your standard Chinese cultivation novel, with a new, albeit thin, coat of paint. One that you should give a try but that isn't a must read. This novel begins very interestingly. Giving a well-done description of the MCs living conditions, attitudes, world and all while making it interesting to read with its futuristic spin on cultivation society. This is short-lived, however. The story very quickly after the interesting first few chapters devolved into your standard novel with all the usual fare you've come to expect. The MC early on, after the interesting start to a potentially interesting world, is given generic Chinese novel MC plot contrivance number 006. In other words, the MC is given memories of an expert by AMAZING coincidence, which allows him to attain the talent to cultivate. This has been done in many other novels, where the MC is given either the memories or help of some expert to help them. Nothing new. From that point on this novel is just your very standard cultivation novel. Nothing of real note really. If you've been reading cultivation novels for as long as I have then you know what to expect. Honestly, this isn't that bad I suppose, because if you're on this site you probably like that style of story. The reason why this story in particular disappointed me is that from the opening I thought this story had to potential to break free from the norm and do something new and interesting. A slow-burning, world-building story, without a plot armor MC, who doesn't need insane luck and talent to be successful. I suppose my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed nonetheless. This is a trend I've found in most Chinese novels. It seems to be the idea that only through luck (destiny) or through having great inborn talent can you ever make something of yourself. I thought this might be different. With the MC climbing up from the bottom, with nothing but his hard work and determination, to prove all those talented young masters wrong! But... in the end, he just gets talent for cultivation thrown into his lap like most other novels. The story might trick you into thinking its unique but it isn't. All of these new and distinct roles for cultivators in modern cultivator civilization in the novel are, story-wise, functionally the same to cultivators in other novels, just with either a different name or different description. All of the characters and plot points are in no way unique to stuff done in other novels, maybe with a new paint job here and there, but nothing amazing. Another disappointing thing is the massive information dumps about the history and the world. A good world is built naturally, over time, through the everyday conversations, adventures, and observations of the characters. Not in very obvious plot contrivances which the author uses to dump information. This has been done twice so far, where it is quite obvious the writer just couldn't think of a better way to get across information, so he makes situations as an excuse to write paragraphs of background. He does do some gradual world development, such as when the MC was walking in the underground city, but the time spent on this is too little, with the author favoring dumps, although it's masked well in places. The translation itself is certainly sufficient to read but still has a fair few small errors here and there. Characters are extremely standard. Although the main characters mysterious dead teacher and his cute flying sword seem somewhat more interesting due to the questions surrounding them. In conclusion, this novel is ok. But that's it. If you were looking for something fresh and brand new to sink your teeth into then I would just keep looking. But if you're just looking for a decent novel to binge for a while then, by all means, go ahead and give this one a try. It is by no means bad, just for me, underwhelming so far.",1050098597

Also, vulture Li Yao is an excellent protagonist who doesn't fail to accomplish impossible feats. The bad guys are not 'dumb' and 'evil', not yet anyway. The backdrop of human-demon war is overused but the sci-fi parts more than make-up for it. The choice of the female lead (Tyrannosaur) is very interesting.

If you want your usual romance, clear distinction between heroes and villains and a happy ever after, then skip this book. If, by chance, you wish for redemption stories, undying and sacrificial love and not your average and cliché plot twists – you have just found a TREASURE! There are no ‘plot holes’ that are not explained in time and no filler characters. If you read it, it matters at some point or another.

I mean his disciple gets captured and beat up for years and, after the disciple is freed at the end of the war, the mc straight up admits that he was too afraid to save his disciple. another thing I'll note is that, while less than other cultivation novels, this novel still suffers from a repetitive plot. but imo, basically all cultivation novels suffer from this so it's not really a bit deal basically, if you like this kind of novel, cool. if you don't, also cool.

I told myself I'll only write this shameless self-review after completing 9 days of mass releases for the WPC. So I'm here now! It would have been impossible to accomplish this without all of the support from you, dear readers, so thank you so much for the motivation. I really would have given up on the daily multiple chapters by now if it weren't for the collections, power stones, comments, and reviews! They were really the strongest motivation and I appreciate each and every single one of them. In terms of the story, I would like to reassure everyone that the main plot line has already been planned out. This novel will span 6 distinct volumes, each dictating a progression of our MC Yan Zheyun's OPness! I hope that my writing will be able to portray this journey in an exciting manner. ^^ As for Volume 1, if my detailed plot outlines aren't wrong, there should be 12 chapters more to go. This means that a big climax in the story is coming soon (the clean kind, non-R18 kind unfortunately LOL). Please bear with the slow burn, I promise that the future story will be filled with dramatic, shocking plot developments as well as an epic romance of a lifetime between our MC/ML. <3 Once again, thanks for the support!",1049764598

Goodness, this is definitely one of the better stories (BL stories at that) that I’ve read on this app. The character description, narration, and dialogue are so creative and cleverly chosen; you can see the author’s intelligence through their words. The world building is perfect (I’m not exaggerating). I’m able to easily tell where everything and everyone is at all times. On top of that, this is an extremely captavating story. (I mean, who doesn’t want to read about a man once at the top, then reduced to the bottom???)(no pun intended🤣) That’s not all, Yan Zheyun is such an admirable character. The author did an amazing job creating him. He’s so clever and quick witted (….and let’s not forget, extremely handsome 😮‍💨✨) I was too afraid to even put the story down. Please please READ!! I definitely recommend this to anyone. As someone who loves historical romances, I will tell any readers like myself, that this story does not disappoint. I haven’t even gotten to the part where the ML is introduced and yet I’m already so excited!! Now, onto reading!! I’m so excited to see how Yan Zheyun will continue on in Yan Yun’s world.

2.19728E+16,1328273271,ScholarMaoLaoshi,4,"What I like most of this novel is how well-thought out it is. What I noticed, while some novels tend to focus fully on the transmigrated life of the MC this novel spends some time to give details of the MCs past life in the way that it adds colour to the MCs character and not just glossed over. Other details can also be seen at various points of the story like some side characters' backstory and design without making it too overwhelming or shoving it into the readers' throat. The romantic development is very much realistic and logical like the pace the progress and how it starts all are very much convincing. Language: I like the effort author puts into the archaic language, Chinese poems and terms though there are some terms that I find quite awkward. While there are some minor grammar mistakes here and there sometimes it doesn't really impede reading experience much. All in all, it's one of the gems in this platform that I very much recommend.

I saved this book in my library a while ago but just recently had the time to pick it back up, and to be honest it didn't disappoint at all (not that it did before). The start was a bit slow but it quickly progresses to my favourite part aka the romance and harem/political intrigue. The plot is sedate yet exciting, even the other POVs give way to a foreshadowing or puzzle pieces without being boring. YZ and LY are the best part of this novel, hands down. Unlike most romance novels of historical genre, the romance is not that slow like watching water drip from a tap or so fast there is no chemistry build-up. The romance is just right and hits the spot, atleast for me. Their background and angst is just the cherry on the top and helps us understand them better. I like all the aspects of this book which is rare for me in this genre (historical) as I get bored with too much one thing (politics/harem intrigue or romance) but you maintain the balance perfectly. Thank you so much for this book. I can't tell you how much I am looking forward for updates. Your work is amazing and I know the research that goes into this so double kudos for that. P.S. Just a favour(not like the one YZ asked LY lol) but the only thing I had a problem with is keeping up with the names, especially, the Scum gongs and the 6 noble families. If you could make a list of them and any vital character that is important in future without giving spoilers, I would be thankful. I want to know who the fifth gong is lol😂",1049764584

I'm actually terribly picky and on this platform, and have only liked about 4 novels and I have read a TON on this, but this story is really good. The Writing Quality is amazing. Honestly, its easy to understand and follow, but also nicely described I can imagine it perfectly and the prose is immersively written in a way that I personally enjoy. The story develops slow and steady, yet doesn't drag on. Sometimes I feel like stories just take ages to form, or are just too fast that everything feels rushed, but this feels balanced. Stuff gets explained, but not too much that it takes away the mystery of other characters and it still sparks the curiosity. I really enjoy the characters and they seem realistic. I can understand them, but that doesn't mean I find some of them less disgusting! XD This Novel updates A LOT in a week (about, like 7 times) The World Background is nice as well, I learn a lot more things than I usually do, and the notes of the Author are informative as well. Personally, I want to learn more information and suck it up like a sponge, so I'm glad that the Author doesn't shy away to explain anything. All in all I can say, the Author radiates intelectual energy and is quite smart :p. Street smart, I mean. Thats way more important than book smart (in my opinion).

1.87246E+16,3079873797,Kapteyn,4,"Overall, a very entertaining story. The Author got a nice way to develop his view of the overused theme VRMMORPG + Reborn MC + OP Knowledge/stats and mixes elements of many different styles. I'll try to summarize without spoilers: PROs: * Elements mixed from Game stories, apocaliptical stories, RPG, etc. * Good background construction and use of background elements - author could make a better descriptions of citys and sites the MC visits, like describing architeture, climate, but, even so, it's not bad the way it is now. * There are many misteries about the world and development of the story, but the author answers a part of this relatively fast. New dramas are constructed in a smooth way, so that we readers keep entertained. CONs: * Writing quality at the beggining is poor, with a lot of grammar errors. It gets better, especialy after 100 chapters. *MC, sometimes, makes stupid decisions, and repeat some nonsenses. In regards of personality, I guess it's ok (there are times i think he looks to be a psyco). But, stuff like having inventory function, and always hunting for food, even knowing that he cant cook. BTW, he could buy any cooking skill in his travels, or some seasoning! * Author has a nasty habit of tricking his readers with comments outside the author's comment area, and using excessively stat and quest views to increase word count and get paid for text that shouldn't be in the story. BTW, this practice makes me not give 5 stars in all the stories I rate with this practice when they go premium.",1049764697

The best part for me is that the book/the author hasn’t reached his full potential and you can see the grow throughout the chapters.

But that can easily be corrected and do not pose any real problem to the comprehension of the story. The world background is unique enough but a bit too vague. It feels like some important informations about it are still hidden, living us ""starving"" for them. I do not know if this is intentional or not but it add some ""addictive"" sensation, keeping me hoocked to the world in general. Character wise, I don’t really know how to rate them, because I read so many books, that nothing feel new apart from mentally unstable characters (and I don’t know how to feel about that) but I will give it a plus because the author is working hard to give them feel ""human"", unlike many novel were you are left wondering how people can still live in a world full of psychos. The story feels a bit slow at some moment, and normal at others. I will give it a plus because it never feel too fast and I personally like that. I don’t know if the feeling of slowness is due to this ""starved for information"" one or because somtime it feel like there are less pages available to read than normal, but as it don’t really affect how I like this novel, it is only a small negative point.

1.87246E+16,4300607324,Shielle,3,"Review at chapter 150 Story, while somewhat cliche, is still pretty good. OP protagonist for the most part for those that like that. Cool concept with the divine class and the demerits that come with it. He doesn't really encounter any ACTUAL danger so far. Feels very low stakes, even if consequences are stated to be high. Characters are downright terrible. All women are written terribly and there's clear, underlying sexism throughout. ""Women are mysterious creatures"" BS. Not to mention how completely dysfunctional the MC's family is. I hope the author isn't projecting too much, cause if they are, I hope they're in a better life situation now. I can't really find one well written character. Also trys to talk about trauma through characters, but it isn't really handled well. My only positive aspect of character design is the MC's clear divide between good and evil. Although I don't typically like 'soft' MCs, Cera's kindness in different scenarios makes total sense and is well executed. Good updater. World is nice for the most part. Cool that NPCs have their own version of world notifications. Issues arise in the total inconsistency of leveling as well as money. Both make little to no sense throughout.",1116547028

9.44949E+15,1732558337,OverpoweredDaoist,1,"Seriously, I regret reading this one. If you are reading this before you read the novel then just stop. I mean it. If you are already reading it, wishing that it will get better then just stop. It will never get better and it will just repeat the old trope of 'my fiancee/friend is kidnapped so I must power up.' I started reading the novel yesterday and I think it's readable at first. 'Cliche powerless transmigrator has a fiancee that gets bought over by a rich man with awesomely high position in the kingdom and to take revenge, the author will give him the godly plot armor.' I'm very interested in this kind of story and I've already read many kinds of novel with the same pattern. They also get utterly bad reviews but nonetheless I still enjoyed them and read them until the end. But damn this novel is utterly bad that I had to waste my time just to write this review. It started interesting to me. MC beats everyone up except the elders who are too strong but it gets annoying as time goes on since MC just can't resolve himself to kill since he is so righteous and his principles will never be broken even if he dies. This is common. It is annoying but the exciting story on how MC will achieve greater reward in the end becoming the thug life of the country and everyone kneels to him makes me enjoy the story. But this novel didn't give a **** about that... In this novel, MC is just a frustrated kid crawling amidst endless storm that just come to him for no freaking reason. All of the young masters are horny for his fiancee, friends and even his treasures. If that's not all, those young masters will not stop at that. The first MC's rival don't even have a shred of pretense and will just keep on sending minions to annoy the MC to death. And this trope of sending troubles will just repeat itself until even the graves of the ancestors of the enemy will crawl up just to make the MC suffer. Of course MC will not die because that would be the end of the story. Random treasures will randomly appear under his feet. Random breakthroughs because those treasures are not completely refined. That's fine in all. It is a cliche in eastern fantasy novel but damn this always happen even afters 400 chapters had already passed. MC has a time cheat where his body will be in a state of time acceleration making him cultivate in almost 500x faster than anybody in real time. And this cheat was never showed its potential at all. It's just a cheat to compensate for his talent which is basically none at all. Author will just randomly say out of nowhere in the fight that MC used his time cheat to comprehend this godly techniques before the fight and boom enemy defeated. Seriously I started loving this novel when Su Yu entered the arc where he was taken in by the Duke to be fostered as a talent and marry the main heroine Xianer but author just flipped the entire novel's potential when everything was in chaos. The prince of the kingdom raided the Duke's palace with a fake imperial edict and now everything is fked. This chapter started the endless cycle of power up and revenge. Story cycle: Friend/Fiancee Kidnapped - - - -> MC powers up by going around the mountaind randomly stepping in godly cultivation treasures - - - - -> Badass MC comes face slapping everyone in his path -------> MC will beat up main target of revenge but all of enemy's allies from the elders, patriarchs, or even the rotting ancestors in the graves will rise up just to beat up the MC until he is coughing up blood in regret asking why the heaven is so cruel - - - - - -> MC will almost die and suddenly discovers a random cave where he will breakthrough to an unknown realm - - - - - - > An even more badass MC will come out with a change of hair color and more handsome than before. He will face slap everyone until he meets an elder who actually has a connection to a powerful sect - - - > Gets beaten down until gets his a$$ saved by a random person - - - > RINSE AND REPEAT",1115858891

The strat was nice but things downgrade quickly. He gets his 1st girlfriend within a day who also accepts all the things he says such as cultivation. She also quickly comes to the fact that he needs a lot more women. She doesn’t seem to be reluctant about it and even actively finds more girls for him. This happens very quickly that itis unreal. All the following characters are similar. They are like ‘I can’t accept sharing.’ Then ‘reluctantly’ accept due to his body which requires more women then bam...they also actively search for new ‘sisters’. All beautiful women he comes across are gonna emd up with him. We cannot even distinguish between them. There is no character development and the world building is horrble.

1.5275E+16,4317729280,Killaruna,3,"So obviously a of negative comments, but the story isn't bad overall. It has good progression but author could explain some things a little better. Biggest downfall, is in the later chapters author just reuses/rewords the same action the MC/other characters do. Still ongoing and from what I've seen on other sites, it's pretty much the same thing. So not sure if author is having a hard time creating material or if it's just so that they can reach minimum words for each chapter. Honestly that's the biggest headache, reading the same thing 3-4 times throughout the chapter and in the end they've only done like 3 actual things throughout it. If it's a creativity issue then my recommendation is to just slow down on number of chapters per week. If it's cause they wanna be lazy and just use the excess as a filler to complete the chapter, then the readers that have made it to the later chapters will likely stop reading as well.

I also liked how well rounded the whole story was. I usually don’t liked multi-POVs in a story but in this case it was well done, making the story more multidimensional. The bond between Jian Ai, her brother and her mother was really wonderful! None of them were over the top and they respected each other’s opinions and decisions wholeheartedly. This highlighted the author’s mature writing style and the ability to portray so many complex characters in a holistic manner. The characters were well-developed and acted their age; be it the adults or young adults. The author did them justice. I wish we got to see more interactions between the three of them. Young Master Ji is such an entertaining character. I really enjoyed reading all the banter between both the FL and ML! The ending was rushed and somewhat abrupt. I wish there was more of how the M Group and how it developed in the future. Maybe an interview between the media and Jian Ai about being hte youngest CEO of such a big enterprise would have been great! Overall, a solid 4 out of 5 stars for me. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",1116548530

As the story goes on, the grammar improves significantly, and copied ideas are few and far between, only appearing to appease plot holes that would otherwise appear.

First, the beginning chapters have been the worst quality of the English language I have ever seen, even from novels that have been translated from another language. The author is constantly using lower level vocabulary, so there are many occasions where he could use a better synonym, or just word the sentence better. The author has also shown very poor use of the English language, starting sentences with ""But"" and poor use of conjunction words. Secondly, this is a blatant ""inspired"" novel from My Vampire System, but the author has inserted what I think are his own power fantasies into it. Thirdly, this is another complaint about the unbearable use of the English language in this novel. The Author is constantly overexplaining things that would be better to have readers infer into, such as living condition.

Sen, who convinced himself that he will destroy humanity as revenge, finds himself as part of this complicated species that constantly tests his true intentions. There is the kind and loving family along with agreeable friends on one side, and the rest of the world on another. The once-dragon is stuck in a conundrum where his newfound care for certain individuals is constantly clashing against his ever increasing list of reasons to end humanity, and kindness is losing. The story could have been more well written, as grammar mistakes aren't that rare to find – some repeated so often they make me question whether it is my knowledge of English which is lacking. The story of the world around the protagonist could have been better exposed, and so could the development of the story itself – though I don't particularly have any insightful recommendation for this. Character development is without a doubt the best this story has to offer, everyone has their own qualities and their own thinking, their actions are also always in accordance to their beliefs and absolutely do not need the MC to do anything with their lives. Promising story overall with qualities rarely seen on web novels, plus Sen's moments of senseless arrogance are definitely entertaining!",1116548990

There are some punctuation and capitalization errors tht I hope the author can polish, but if you can get past that, this is an entertaining story. I also like the humor--the baby's seemingly innocent behavior and antics turn out to be actually the dragon's ""rebellion"". And that's only for starters.

1.56533E+16,3166382108,GianP,2,"So I should leave a review since I had great hope for this novel, but was disappointed. I will list the problems: 1. Grammar ...simply, it sucks. I can understand that English is not the author's first language, but there are like 10 grammar mistakes each chapter. Please, use a proofreader it's really distracting from the story. There, they're and their are different. Please learn it. 2. Writing style The limites of the language hits hard in the style department. Since the author doesn't master the language, phrases are always linear and simple, concepts are expressed one at a time etc... This impacts the story since it seems the actors themselves are basic. 3. Plot holes, world building, etc I understand you don't want infodumps, and you also don't want to spoiler the story but... Seriously, try to give a reason for things happening, and not at chapter 1000 since people will not arrive there. Sen is acting like a true 5 yo even being a 1000 yo dragon. Is there a good reason? Maybe. Without explaining, or even an hypotesis, this is simply a plot hole. Whatever is inside the mind of the author doesn't count, only what is written. And don't go ""but normal books can explain after 200 pages, why can't I?"" Normal books are supposed to be perfect in language use, have been read and revisited multiple time by the author and the editor team, so the reader is somewhat assured that the story is somewhat decent. On webnovel the author publishes BEFORE finishing the story and often before checking for errors. Maybe in chapter 300 the author is like ""oooops for plot reason I need this in chapter 30... Too bad it's already published. Let's hope nobody notices"" while in a normal book you would go and modify chapter 30 to be coherent. Now, I have gone for a bit of a rant here. TL;DR: the story is simple but ha potential... Wasted because of poor English and oversimplification",1111622792

It's fine and good that he has difficulty understanding humans and human emotion, but it's not okay to give him a clear path via the system to increase his strength, even assuming he can't apply any of his dragon knowledge to strengthening himself as a human, then let him spend no time training during a ten year timeskip.

My Vampire System has been continuously ranked in Webnovel's top ten for over a year and I want to read its prequels before I get to it. Well, MDS is a beginner novel and it shows. The MC is good, some side characters are alright, but the rest of the cast is average to bad. The background is barebone. The power system is vague, badly implemented and the worst I've ever read. The story is awful, incomplete, full of deus ex machina and feels overall artifical, leading to a rushed and unsatisfactory ending. Finally, the writing is terrible, full of typos, bad grammar, characters confusions, mistakes on homophones. Really, I work as an English teacher, and none of my students, even the worst of them, would make so many errors. I hope JKSManga took an editor/proofreader with his other novels, otherwise, reading them will be a torture. So, I hope the next volumes of the My System trilogy are better, it seems they are, but after such an experience, it will be some time before I read the second book. My final verdict is a 1 out of 10 (my first). If you want to read a very good/excellent dragon-themed novel, go for Coiling Dragon by I Eat Tomatoes, that's the novel that brought me to Chinese novels, and it is awesome.

Granted they are mainly stuck in the academy so I'll give it a pass. Finally, I wish is that he would combine some of the chapters to lesson the daily cost of the book.

Most of the stuff that it shares is only surface level things, and it is also only in the beginning of the story. After the first ark, more or less, Online starts to pave it’s own way, becoming it’s own story. The characters were the opposite of what I expected. I assumed they were going to lean more into having npc types of behavior. I was unmistakably wrong about this assumption which is ironic considering the fact that this is a vr story. Even up to the current chapters I’m sharing the thoughts of the main character. Is it actually real or is it just a game? Thoughts like these keep me on the edge of my seat whilst reading Online. The world building is simply phenomenal, which is a trend in Delz’s work. Every thing is described in vivid detail while at the same time not going overboard( this could sometimes halt the reading process)(for me at least). The pacing is slow, but stable and the whole story itself appears to be a slow burn. Last, but not least the action scenes. The fights and anything related to action is very detailed. After reading the action, visualizing it using my imagination is super simple. Another thing I like is how the fighting styles and magic in Online kind of reflect the characters utilizing them.

I think the dialogue is smooth flowing and realistic to the setting and period.Desctiptions are also niche, there's never too may unnecessary adjectives. I really love the story and there's lots of mysteries to be uncovered. The characters are easy to imagine and very diverse in appearance and personality. The powers are cool. I really like the main character. I think he's a really interesting one. I don't really know how to articulate my thoughts on him but yeah I like him and I am also fond of the supporting cast.

2.07905E+16,4319966913,SinLucifer15,5,"I started reading this two days before this review and let me tell you, ive binged all 288 chapters currently released. This novel is so far my favorite Novel on this entire platform. The brilliance of the Background, character development, and overall the writing in general, speaks leaps and bounds of wgat separates this masterpiece from the abundance of writing on this site. There are no info dumps and the characters pasts as well as the worlds past, come gradually and are expertly implemented inti the story in an ebtertaining and shockingly perfect way. Also may i commend the author for writing the mc so well. You by far made the correct choice in making the mc so edgy, it solidifies the uniqueness and masterful complexity of the novel. The plot twists constantly keep me on the edge of my seat and reading for hours. The chapter length is perfectly sized to not be too long nor too short, but right in the sweet spot. I am personally very excited to see what you will do with Hanah’s charcter. I could go on and on about how perfect this novel is but i will never explain it good enough to do it justice, just know that you should read this. You will not regret reading this absolute masterpiece, but keep in mind it takes time for the development of everything, but you will see how that only makes it even more perfect.",1115858311
2.07905E+16,4313229687,TheArcher7,4,"Where do we draw the line between good and evil? When can a villain's violent nature and blood-soaked past be used for good? A lot of readers get hooked by the carnage or the humor. Indeed, the interactions can be humorous, but there are deep moral dilemmas too. The author isn't afraid to give us a pure evil MC. He's even added some coding for prejudices about race and mental health even though the main focus seems to be on the morality behind actions. The MC kills for fun, but loves his family, and probably will learn to love others too. Mega Girl has the outer appearance of doing good, but this might be due to her mysterious conditioning and not her own inner moral compass. There's an overarching moral question hidden outside the mechanics of their superpowers, and behind the curtains of the comedy. I never thought I would enjoy unpacking it, but I am! All the strong people in this book have a flaw with their morality that changes how we can perceive their actions. It's fascinating! I'm up to ch140 and I can't wait to see where this goes. Now, judging the writing itself, the gender pronouns he/she sometimes get switched, which breaks immersion. Also, the world building seems to dumb down political powers to make individual characters seem smarter, which is a little lazy. The high-class academy gets attacked by villains way too easily, imo, but that is mostly the oversaturated market and exposure. I still enjoy every bit, no matter how cheesy or ""edgy"" 9/10 would reccomend. It's just one step away from being as good as Super Minion on Royal Road.",1116547313

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Gary the best ever?! (readers will understand me). The writing quality needs to be improved. The author messed up the pronouns quite a few times... by that, I mean her/him pronouns only. Other than that. A more consistent update would be better. At least 1chp/ day, so webnovel standard is reached. That's all the flaw I can say. The characters in this novel are so fleshed out.

I would not read this if you expect high-quality writing & high standards overall. First and foremost, I think everyone can agree this is pretty much a comedy and yes, Gary is a real G. The author has, in my opinion, improved from their previous work (Hermes System) as this seems to be more fleshed out, unique with how the bizarre the characters, and so on. I don't usually bother to read majority of things on Webnovel because they seem to be... highly similar to each other i.e. system novels & etc. This, however, made me glad I searched the power rankings, which led me to this gem.

The development of the story is not so okay for me. It was just the MC, meeting survivors, conflicted if he should save them or not, in the end he will still save them. Character design, is pretty much nonexistent. The MC, doesn't develop his character. He's a self righteous man (I wanted to say the word B but that doesn't seem proper). He contradicts himself at every turn. He said he wants to be alone, but at every chapter, he's either with some survivor or some survivor. I have a long list of complaints of this but I won't detail that much. Updating stability, don't know but with the number of chapters the stability of updating looks good. World background, the settings was super slowly being revealed. The monsters, the why's, etc. I would have rated this 2 stars but since I like some aspects of the story I rated it 3 stars.",1115858270

I mean it's alright that he want's to alone but he goes too extreme. He became angry when he lost a fight or someone looks down on him. It's kinda like those annoying xianxia young master attitude. It doesn't make sense that he create all this fuss since he only trained for two months and they are stronger than them.

2.19348E+16,4314923588,Colr_Gren,5,"Trial Read Review (only from synopsis): (X:ICATDOHP) - So the protagonist gets reincarnated with the power to change the dates (how old or young they are) of herbs. He is a herb disciple (good for him) and since plants are more powerful when older, he modifies the plants and consumes them making him stronger. Not going to lie, this plot seems mediocre and bland. Maybe I will check it out. (YTIBIWBMS) - This is one of those talent stealing novels. That is literally all the synopsis covers and it doesn't really talk much about the plot. There have already been many novels similar to this one and I will only check it out if I am bored. (ITRWISG) - Basically, the protagonist is in a modern world where he can see stats and stuff like a game while no one else can’t. This plot has been overused so much and usually comes with an extra plate of face slapping. The sad thing is that I’m already full. (MR) - Out of all of the other trial novels this time, this seems like the one with the most plot and potential. Honestly, I can’t really understand what the plot is because the synopsis is short but it hooks you into the story (somewhat). I will check it out. (P9Y:AAMFFY) - Protagonist transmigrates into the modern world and gets a funeral system. He also has a funeral company (you can see where this is going). Basically, he can make amazing things happen at your funeral, but that’s all. Unique plot but honestly kind of lackluster. Maybe I will read it. (LOTP:IRAMSFTS) - Guy can get land and stuff and summon succubi and this plot is overused and seems generic blah blah blah (hey, it’s like 2:00 for me over here, don’t blame me for being sloppy). Anyway, bad. Wouldn’t recommend it.",1116552800

There are however a few minor typo's every few chapter that are probably due to autocorrect. I.E: Brian becomes brain. Story Development 4.5/5: The story focuses Mc's inventions/discoveries used for the betterment of others, be it individuals or entire communities. Something I'd like more of is POV's from different characters it's one thing to see the improvements of the Burtons via the MC another entirely from the POV of say a guard. Character Design 4/5: The MC is too OP... Well that is sort of the point but I think I'd enjoy the story more if the MC had to work together with say Ceasar to perfect the manuals for the major heavenly laws. In the end it feels as if other major characters in the story can never measure up to the MC.

2.1028E+16,4320030767,MogeIman,3,"Before I get to reviewing this, let me preface this by saying that I still thoroughly enjoy reading this despite the brain-cells I lost. Now on to my review. TLDR very nice story, with subpar writing and characters but is excellent for passing time. 1: Writing Quality: Let us be honest, the writing is garbage. The author jumps between tenses constantly and uses the same phrases over and over again. This sort of writing makes the story bland and often messes with my immersion. I would suggest the author to go and get an editor to help him proofread the writing. I don't mean this as an insult to the author, I very much like the premise of the story and I would love to see it executed well, writing-wise. 2: Stability of Updates: Not much to be said here, as I am not fully caught up. 3: Story Development: I love the pacing of the story. It very much complements the ""War & Military"" aspect of the story. I love Kingdom Building stories and I like when they are executed well. Plot wise and Pace wise, the author is doing a great job. 4: Character Design: I had this at 3 stars before but now I made it 2 simply because there is no one character in this story that is unique. I know this what you typically expect of a cultivation novel, but that should never excuse the author of falling into the same troupes. All, and I mean literally every last one of them including the MC, is one dimensional. Side characters that have no brain of their own: check, FL that is cold and strong at first, but turns into an extension of the MC with absolutely nothing to add: check, an ambitious MC that... you get the idea. Character Interactions: This is a part of character design, however it is highly dependant on how well the author designs the characters personalities and such. So when you have all the same looking characters you get the same character interactions at every turn. MC meets someone new, said person disrespects him, mc says or does something, said person is amazed. and just repeat the process. 5:World Background: The world has a very nice premise. It has been perfectly illustrated thus far. The rules of the world have also been stated, which means the various power dynamics are clear and make sense. This sets the stage for a very nice kingdom building developments. Nicely done. To be honest I wouldn't have written this review if I didn't believe in the potential of this story. And to the author, if you are reading this I would like to say the following. This is your story and as the author/ creative mind behind it. You have every write to explore. Don't bind yourself to the troupes and limits that have been set. Explore with your writing, experiment with the characters. Make them awfully cruel, kind, brave and cowards. Or a mix of all of these, because one characteristic can never describe a human being otherwise they turn into caricatures. Try to make the world move even if the MC didn't exist, cus right now it doesn't feel like that. All I want to say is, experiment and go wild with it. All the best.",1115860069

There are knights, saints and sages. But what they can do or what's the difference between real is never explained. The world is unknown. We know some countries and cities name but we don't know where they are. The characters aren't very well constructed. What are their aspirations ? What do they like? They power up and that's it. It's just cultivating and nothing else. The MC is ""smart"" but he makes stupid decisions which works because the author makes him succeed. I mean, he is boastful of how quick he can make others cultivate and everything is fine because he knows others will see the benefits he brings, bla bla bla. But not everything is logical in life and you can't predict all things correctly. He shows too much while being too weak. I'm sure there are other things but I stopped after 60 chapters.

A character will make a move that is described as full-proof and smart but if you were to look a bit closer, it's simply not. It also suffers from what I'd like to call ""OP Character takes risk for no reason"" where the mc will take large risks despite not getting much from it.

She's really boring and just seems like a mashup of every op Mary Su character. The antagonist are really unbelievable! Ye ting is really annoying, but it's even more annoying the way the protagonist does nothing about her. I don't know if she handles Ye ting, I haven't made it that far. I'm on ch250+ and it drags so much it's a little boring. Another person I don't like is Chu Haun. I don't know what it's like to be reunited with a sibling after finding out the other sister wasn't your biological sister, but the way he acts is really annoying! I wanna know how old is the protagonist for her to be so unfazed by everything people do or say. And then there's the family. Are they an after thought? It's like they're just a stepping stone for Chu Ning. To make her look good or get her out of situations so she doesn't seem too op. It doesn't make sense to have 7 capable brothers but yet look at the life they live? Yeah they all are gonna be big shots, but that was on their own. Now it's like everything they achieve is because of Chu Ning. I just find it a little unnecessary. I also saw someone say that this protagonist isn't op. What story did you read?

Now this is just me personally, others might love her personality but I find her boring and a little too clinical. I like faults in a character, just enough for them to seem relatable and this FL is just too perfect, which makes her bland for me. I can’ connect to her emotionally and that frustrates as I was looking forward to this one. But when you’re enjoying and connecting more with the side characters more than the FL, you can kinda tell this novel won’t be for you. I was hoping for more to happen round her family, especially after reading the summary and her family is still nothing more than of a footnote 200 chapters in. It’s lucky if we get more than 2 paragraphs of an interaction after the 50 chapter mark. We get a lot more of the friendship and career aspect rather than family so I found that disappointing. I probably continue but it’s not a novel I’ll be unable to put down and lose sleep over. But not bad if you need something to put in the time.",1116548893

Cao song will find different way to harm / kill XT or XT's loved ones and XT will have to do much things to save them. Author, we all know this kind of story plot and it's toooooo boring 🤧. if it 1,2 times then it's okay but it's not good to keep repeating it. We all readers have read this kind of plot thousands of time. So I want to suggest something. why not make XT kind of Anti-hero / evil mc. He is gang leader, add some detective kind people group for him. who collects all information for him and keep him updated about new rising stars or his competitor in current scenario. so it is kind of information network for XT. Now if you make story like after XT Argus with Teng Qigang. XT will ask his information group to find all details about Teng Qigang, his background and his boss and all thing. XT will plan to destroy Cao Song and Teng Qigang before even they can do anything to XT. this kind of anti-hero feels much better than that boring same hero plot. XT will use this group to find all competitor and destory them before they even know who's is planning in background. please consider this suggestion and see if you can add it in upcoming story plot. 😁😁",1111623576

First of all, this is a vague spoiler, but it makes me sick to see the mother not even give her biological daughter a chance to have a relationship with her. She dislikes her for no reason at all & it makes me upset every time reading her coldness, though thankfully she hasn't plotted to physically harm FL like they usually do in other similar stories. The good thing is that FL doesn't care to much about her & her so called family & instead is focusing on living her best life with her abilities. Though readers may want her to leave her household already & be done with them, the pacing & development of the story is well. Things aren't being rushed nor does any plotline feel out of place. As for romance, even in the chapter 100s there is no over the top sweetness, or dating, but FL & ML do have good feelings toward each other.

This involves a CEO who is also an alpha who looks cold and arrogant but he is also someone who is clueless sometimes when he is with his mate and he is someone who will do anything for his pack and his family. This is a story which involves kids born out of wedlock but who will be so protective of their mother even against their father. This is a story similar but so so different from the rest out there.

2.13891E+16,4319814700,SilverLuna10,5,"Love the story, hate the paywall xD. But seriously it's my favourite werewolf story I read. It's unique that Alpha's mate is human and that he doesn't have geolocation of her. I like how Nate realized that Lara is his mate and he has pups with her after meeting her after six years immediately instead of usual in C-novels hundreds of chapters where FL hide fact of children's father's identity from ML. I love also that while FL was virgin and didn't have other men than ML he was also inexperienced and then completely loyal during their break. I hate it when FL has to be pure while ML was fooling around with other women. I really love ML. He is perfect husband and father for hurt and traumatized Lara and children. I admire his patience to always put Lara first and let her take first step in intimacy instead of usual CEO's molesting FL to get her agree to sleep with him. And I really like that Lara needs some time to feel comfortable instead of going with him to bed because they're mates and it makes them attracted to each other. And love their gradual developing relationship. They actually get to know each other, go on dates, start with hugs and kisses to develop naturally to getting married soon. It is what really lacks in novels. I like their courtship even though they already have children. And Jaden and Scarlet are great. Love how protective they are of their mother and that they show some difficulties after being raised by single mother. They act like children their own age even if they are more mature and sensible because Lara had to leave them alone when she worked. Firstly neither children nor Nate were happy about each other. Then we see why they need father and that Nate fulfills that role even if in the beginning he didn't love his children yet. Their relationship also gradually developed from dislike to being comfortable with each other to loving each other. And even though Nate was reluctant of being father in the beginning though he still wanted his children and being constantly jealous of them taking all his mate's attention he still worked hard to get his children affection even if it was because Lara loves their children. Now he totally loves them and children also accepted him as their father. Review is only for first 300 chapters because like I said I hate paywall and need to gather fast-passes to continue story.",1115859970

She leaves no stone unturned to keep her cubs happy and well fed even when she is always changing cities and jobs. And what fo I say about Jaden and Scarlet? They are evil twins but cute and loving too. Their only vice which is their good quality too is that they love their mom a lot. I had expected the Alpha to be possessive.

1.5118E+16,222845380,Azunyan,5,"This is going to have spoilers for up to ch 17. Go away if you don't want to be spoiled. GENERAL SUMMARY:The story begins at a sort of mid point after an event. The MC who is a certified genius at the high school he goes to got beat up by this girl who had no reason to beat him up. (turns out she is his step sister bc his dad is going to marry her mom. He also has a step brother that ain't friendly either) Now the MC discovered that a phone that was stored in their house and forgotten was a relic from ancient ruins that his grandfather helped in excavating. That phone allows him to basically raid dungeons with a game avatar and reviving the avatar only costs a drop of blood. However, all that the avatar collects in the game translates over to reality with benefits. Because of that, the MC keeps on playing that and sleeping so other people think that he got into a slump and gave up on trying. MC obviously proves that he is fine and dandy later on, but somehow no-one seems to be aware of that because his step siblings think he is trash and the other teachers are just unaware. Luckily there isn't too many side character that are rubbish. The step siblings tho... they just suck. OPINION: So I think that this story is worth a read. The MC has an apathy about him that makes him not really care about others except his dad so he sort of just strolls along in life while others seem to care a bit too much about details. However, this makes it really difficult to get a read on the MC, I mean he didn't care that his step brother basically screwed up his chance to be on a really good team for practical examinations. Like the personality of the MC in a phrase would be: calm to the point of being apathetic. The other side characters were reasonable and had common sense in their actions. Step-siblings not really tho. They are just out to make the MC miserable. The general world set up without factions and crap is really similar to shadow hack, modern cultivation stories, and dungeon raiding kind of stories. At a certain point in time, dimensional zones AKA dungeons appeared and monsters came out from those. Humanity adapted to it and now there are special abilities and other cultivation like crap that are present. Currently tho there seems to be no threat of monsters coming out or anything like that. That about wraps up the review.",1116547784

But over time my ""taste"" has matured, there are some novels that I liked before that I can't read a chapter now, with time I realized how poor most Chinese novels are. This novel is this: Poor, there is nothing new, nothing interesting, it is always the same thing: Young master, young lady, slaps in the face, miraculous treasure, several chapters dedicated to something that can be solved in a SINGLE sentence , stupid crowd, the protagonist is despised by everyone, and an eternal escalation, there is always someone more talented, someone more powerful, other worlds more developed, other dimensions with another race, another multiverse ... I don't want to offend anyone, but Chinese readers seem to suffer from some kind of mental illness, I don't understand how popular these ""things"" are in China, Chinese communism imprisons the brain of its people, originality is dying.

1.5118E+16,4310727111,WN_Enthusiast,1,"This review is solely my own opinion. People who like these kinna crap usually post their 5 stars. Ppl who don't like it typically just drop the novel without any review. Thats why this kinna garbage gets pretty high ranking in my opinion. So i wanted to share my thoughts for any likeminded individual and/or for whoever cares. I haven't encountered such a spineless, retarded and prideless MC in a while. This dude got no self respect. I read upto ch 87 hoping it would improve but nope. His step sis-to-be comes to his school and beat his ass, his step bro-to-be tries to destroy his future and he is cool with it. He constantly says that he doesn't wanna be dependent on his new family and their status for self improvement but he takes everything they give him. Like EVERYTHING. His step mom marries his useless piece of turd dad to get to him so that he can use him to win something (i won't mention for heavy spoiler), he is fine with it too. His step mom literally tells him i am gonna take care of my own kids (understandable) before you but participate in tourney for me which i already enrolled you in without asking you to win the aforementioned something for my family. How shameless could you be to ask that from a step son who you met not even weeks ago? She didn't even ask his permission before she nominated him for such a dangerous task and his step siblings are vengeful abt it. He didn't reject her either and going by how it has gone so far. He will most likely accept it too. I am in ch 87 and MC hasn't even stepped up one realm. How else could author milk the money if he doesn't unnecessarily lengthen the novel under the guise of world building? Overall this guy is a marvelous little biatch and hypocrite. But go ahead and read if you like these and be your own judge. I am dropping it and i will remember the author to avoid next time.",1116548091

The world that is built in this story is fascinating, and it continues to expand as the novel progresses. The changes to Earth are still partially unknown to the human race, which leadsleads to a sense of mystery in the story. The main character comes off as lazy at first, but we slowly find out that he has a special gift for concentration that aids him in learning skills and cultivation techniques. He gets into many funny situations, like spouting random BS to another student, who later declairs him as his master when it helps him have a breakthrough. As the story progresses, the MC realizes his own weakness and strives to be one of earths most powerful protectors.

1.5118E+16,2683986193,plastic_doll,2,"Trash.. that's as far as I can say. Everything is predictable in this novel. The clichés and tropes are all here. Cheat, old pervert grandpa, accidentally acquiring peak world cultivation technique etc. The author loves to repeat a thing for 5 paragraphs in different ways. MC learnt a technique that the existence at the peak of the world couldn't learn because of his FOCUS, lol. What the author loves to do too is force the MC to do things, like saving some female degenerate just to get him in trouble, or going to a university that's supposed to be the backyard of his enemies even though he knows of it. You know all that ""forced"" stuff. MC: calm, and a wood bloke. that's all nothing more. honestly Im trying but I just can't think of more. Side characters: the only redeeming character for even a bit is probably that young master that pretended he was someone he's not just to fool his family. But the rest is ugh don't make me start a rant on his family or step-family makes me want to burn the book. Oh and this book supposedly isn't harem not sure though since I haven't read very deep into the novel but it keeps giving me this On and Off harem thing. Or maybe I'm just too paranoid? I don't feel it's worth doing in depth review, just not worth it. Anyways don't recommend at all.",1111623508

Writer is willing to come up with a lot of new ideas but he refuses to define them, it's very annoying, for example when he/his pets get a skill his useless phone doesn't explane what they are they, he leaves them ambiguous to define them later as to what the situation needs. He gets a weird letter from his stepmother's father, he doesn't discuss it with her, why? no reason, later he finds out that he (his step mom's father) is stuck somewhere and his step mother is going to a dangerous place to find him, she asks the MC if her father left anything with him, he says no, why? nobody knows, does he even try to figure it out? NO, IT HAS BEEN MORETHAN 400 CHAPTERS! CMON MANNNNN. sorry I lost my self. the dialogue between the MC and the other characters is lacking a lot, for example when any character becomes a little bit more rational and starts to think and ask good questions the writer decides to shut them up with ""sense they didn't tell me I can't ask them"" line, like Huhh? it's just lazy and annoying. and jäk's arc was so irrational, brainless, stupid and trying too hard, he is an evil man he doesn't abide by laws and kills people left and right on a whim, with a lot of difficulty we were able to capure him and imprison him, now let's cut him a deal if he can capture a 16 year's old kid at the legendary stage and bring him over we will let him be free again to kill more people and cause chaos in this chaotic world.

2.10921E+16,3588196474,Lightscribe,5,"Disclaimer: Long time yuri fan, have read over 100 yuri books alone, most of my read history is gl. Now that I made this clear, it's obvious I'm a little biased. But I still think this is 100% worth the read. The characters of both Cynthia (the system) and Emilia (the mc) are superbly done and their interaction is adorable. Even with other characters. It looks like the main plot will take a while? but I think it should be worth it. Btw compared to your other book the dialogues here are definitely better. Maybe the less serious undertone or maybe just the MC is personality being different. I just like it ig. [img=update]",1111623584

2.10921E+16,4314056295,WhYDoIEVeN,4,"Oh yes I'm finally doing a review. First of all writing style. I like it, and I like it a lot (with a few exceptions), there are few grammar mistakes. It's in neatly arranged paragraphs, well most of it anyways. The only complaint I have about it is that character speech is separate from the paragraph, since it reduces the amount of content and potential physical movements and reaction when writing a conversation. So, 4.2/5 Next, Stability of Updates. Nothing needs to be said about this. It's updates every day. 5/5 Story Development wise, it's going a bit slow for a non-SoL (which, as of current, the story should be tagged as such since it seems to be a Slice of Life currently), but excluding that. The pacing is mostly fine. Nothing much to talk about here. 3.8/5 The story is mostly at the beginning, so there's not a lot to talk about World Building wise. But what we've seen so far has been pretty good, so for now I'll give it a 4/5 Character Design, oh how much I have to talk about in this topic. Let's go over the protagonist first; Emilia. She's a character alright, a scheming and possessive girl worthy of being called a villainess. Currently, as of chapter 61 she's still staying true to her character. And I really like her, as a protagonist since there's not many ""Evil"" Protagonist stories. And even then most of them are either full on ero, just idiotic, or has really bad writing but people think it's good. So this is a change I appreciate. Also, the system is actually something fun to have around and life-like for once, which is simply great. (Also Cynthia x Emilia for the win) Then we have the support characters, what brings a story to life. The current arcs supporting cast is basically a bunch of misfit; a knight complex simp, a siscon elder sister, a pure heroine who's not really as pure as you think, an idiot for a hero, etc. The cast is good enough that the story doesn't seem bland, even when the protagonist is out of the picture in that POV. I would say that it's the best aspect of the story. 6/5 TLDR; If you want to enjoy a good villainess story that isn't so cliché for once, this is for you. If you love and adore yuri, this is for you. If you want to see the ""good"" side suffer, this is for you. And if not, I still recommend you check it out, because this is simply an amazing story. Overall score; 4.6",1116552581
2.10921E+16,4312894709,Hora010,4,"the first 70 chapters are great, honestly really good read but after that for the next 80 chapter (i read till 150) the pacing becomes terrible it feels like you changed lane from a road right into a swamp that just drags you down. The main plot doesn't really advance there is some progress on the romance but that's also pretty slow since there are like ten girls which are being seduced simultaneously and the plot focuses heavily on side quests which are well written but ultimately are pretty minor when it comes to overall impact especially in contrast to the first chapters. The schemes are exceedingly well written and besides for Cynthia which i find purely annoying every character is pretty fun and unique. Definitely give this one a try and see if it fits your taste you won't regret it",1115859942

The first world doesn't really have dark schemes and somehow light, pretty enjoyable to read, but I know she will soon leave and I'm reluctant to part to this world, Author is giving time and attention for the first arc that makes me attached to the characters, I don't know if I can let go easily.

I want to skip to the end of the first arc, but somewhere in the 300+ chapters I skipped a few things happened and I’m not gonna bother to sift through the filler to find something that actually matters.

The start was quite good and has a lot of potential but overtime it has started to become a slowburn fanservice novel. Instead of plot advancement, several continous chapters are spent with flirting, teasing, and getting chummy2 with the female characters. By chapter 190+, she was not even close to being at the top of 'that world.' Now here's the thing, the intro said there are many worlds out there. How many chapters will that make? How boring will it become by then? Author should've considered plot advancement first and foremost like getting 1 to 3 girls per world instead of making it into some sort of yuri slice of life (In the first world no less). To put it simply, I just can't picture out the future of this novel. It was like the novel itself is some sort of fan service comedy. Anyways, I was quite disappointed since I've read the other novel 'Rebirth of evelyn knox' was it? Now that was certainly good, with clear plotline and all. Anyways, Ciao!",1116547754

2.10921E+16,4319813650,ScholarlyInsomniac,5,"Couldn't recommend this story more highly. This story really takes a fun approach to an Isekai and does something that so few of them do: create compelling characters! Our Heroine (Villainess) has actual depth and burdens that weigh upon her heart and motivate specific courses of action through understandable, human reasons. Now that I praised the story's mechanics, I can say that I barely care about that at all. The most important aspect of this story is that it is fun. It doesn't concern itself with making the main character struggle every step of the way or adding high stakes to every encounter. Climax and escalation are present in smaller arcs, but they aren't the driving factor in the story. Fun is. Whether the inner bickering of Cynthia and Emilia or a certain girl insisting to herself that she's totally straight when I think everyone would agree that she's about as straight as a rainbow slinky being stretched by competing gravitational forces, you'll have a smile on your face. This isn't a 'feel good' story about love and kindness or any of that nonsense. Rather, it's a wonderful, whimsical story fueled by someone taking their emotion trauma in stride as they accrue a harem in a non-cringy, comedic way. It's just fun, and is absolutely worth a read. TLDR: This story is cute and fun in ways that are only enhanced by having actually good characters. It'll put a smile on your face. Read it.",1116547255

I was quite happy with them. the ending was kinda soft for lack of a better word. but the author tied up all loose ends so I really have no complaints. what I did not like was that some chapters could have been left out and the book would still be great. like some that were entirely of passersby gossiping about an ongoing incident with not much new infon or someone having an introspection ends up repeating all the great stuff about FL and ML with no new info. fortunately, the book's chapters were short so the over 3000-chapter book did not feel that long.

The story keeps focusing on irrelevant details but when something important comes up it's only mentioned in half a sentence that is very ambiguous and open to interpretation, not in a mysterious way but in a *i don't know where the story is going so let's leave it open* way. 4.

Yes, you read that right. This author doesn't know what a galaxy is. As for the rest: - Translation is full of mistaken identities(wrong names in places) - Everything in this novel is vague af, no details about anything relevant whatsoever - No world building whatsoever. Don't even know what year this novel takes place in. - Passing of time is dumb af. Sometimes between 2 sentences weeks pass without an indication of it whatsoever. - Author has successfully insulted just about every demographic other than ""Asian"". As the author nicely put it - ""Asia is the birthplace of human civilization."" - lul k, among other derogatory statements. - PLAGIARISM - this author literally took Eminem's ""Not Afraid"" and some other songs and presented them as works of his characters. - An insane number of contradictory statements made by the author. Won't go into details, but just know that anything said in regards to ""world building"" and ""story development"", other than random insults to women made by the author, are fiction open to be changed in the next sentence, paragraph or chapter at the authors whim. - The entire virtual game industry in this novel makes no f'in sense. + Lots of characters actually have their own personalities.

7.92231E+15,4302719185,daoi13,2,"First of all, this author seems to have a problem with women and everyone who isn't ""asian"" (probably means chinese). There's plenty derogatory remarks about women and ample statements how asia, asians or asian culture is the best and everyone else falls behind. To some degree that's not exactly unusual for CNs but it's a bit too prevalent in this novel for my taste. The Translation is decent. There are no glaring grammar or spelling mistakes. But there's also no regard for sentence structure or ""reading flow"". So while you won't have problems understanding the story, it is also not an enjoyable read. The story is just bad though. Character design is about the only positive point I can find. Other character (than the MC) actually have their own personalities. They're not mindless puppets or empty dolls like you'll find in some other CNs. There's no ""arrogant young master #123"" and the characters aren't just stereotypes. But the world building and story progression is beyond bad. The story is nothing but a ""look how awesome I am"" show for the MC and the world building makes no f*ing sense. Not to mention there are tons of plotholes. For example: The MC chooses a humanoid Mecha in the virtual game world and everyone makes fun of him because of it, since the humanoid mecha has no armor. But then the MC goes on to oneshot everyone of his opponents anyway. So what exactly was the purpose of armor in the first place, if it doesn't protect against hits? And why would NO ONE ELSE get the idea ""maybe dodging could work""?",1115858627

The song ‘I'm Not The Only One’ was the culprit that got me inspired. When I first heard the song playing, I suddenly had this urge to write a story that I may consider not the best but it was enough to tug into heartstrings. Before I could understand what's happening the scenes just began to play in my thoughts. I name the FL Phoenix because it's a symbolic meaning of hope. Like the bird Phoenix, the FL will rise from the ashes of her failures to build the empire of her success. I made her weak because I want to teach some values in life. I want her to struggle and improve herself. She's not just a woman but a powerful one! I name the ML Ace because when I first imagine him, it was the name that popped in my mind and from then on I can't shake it off my head. He was the Villain I first introduced in the story and the readers hated him for that. He was a jerk and I mean it! He has a lot of leasson to learn. I swear I will not make it easy for him. This has mature scenes and triggering content. Readers discretion is adviced!",1115858630

The author did the cliche plot of ex liking her when she's better but this author is too bad. Her love interests include her ex, her ex's elder half brother, really random artistes, some of whom she hasn't even met, her co-worker who she is helping. The last one annoyed me the most. He began having feelings when she was only trying to help him, gets irritated when she's with her boyfriend, who is actually her husband, does things that he knows are wrong and he has illustrated certain tendencies. I tolerated it in my heart, thinking that they wouldn't have any further interaction, then they conveniently accidentally kissed.

There are also errors so it needs editing. ** Spoilers: You have a girl who transmgrates into a novel right in front of civil bureau where the guy she was supposed to marry doesn’t come. She ends up marrying the ML instead. The whole intro was funny actually with her thinking the whole thing was a dream 😂. I will say that I love the relationship between the ML and FL even though I don’t understand it. I don’t get why the ML just chose to marry her when he knew absolutely nothing about her. He also seems to like her from the beginning for no reason. Hopefully this will be explained later. ML is loyal and a doting hubby. He also expects loyalty since they’re married, which is understandable. FL has me questioning her intelligence a bit by not immediately removing herself from the lives of the original novels ML and FL. She continues to work at their company as a music composer. I think she will leave working for them soon though. The novel isn’t bad but would have been better with more detailed explanations and descriptions. Also should be a little bit slower paced.

Our futuristic chef doesn’t make a name for herself or do anything remarkable, besides the initial noodle cart. After that, the only Interest worth continuing to read Would be how the relationship with her husband goes. BtW, don’t hold your breath. It’s a lost cause. I mean you would think there would be some development, but the author is dead set on separating them with a relationship equivalent to young teenagers. This is where the plot goes downhill. You have a General who’s won the war, but can’t return to the countryside. Naturally he would be bring his wife and son to him and make a home in the capital. But not in this case!! She just acts like he’s an after thought and would rather go back and live with her animals. To her, the husband’s an afterthought. The husband’s a simp who basically makes all the effort for their relationship. I’m not fond of FL with prude like tendencies; who have zero experience in intimacy or relationship at their old enough age. Even if you want to push aside the romance, this FL has nothing going for her. She has so much cooking talent, but she’s not making any strides.

1.98115E+16,4300704401,MythicSnow,5,"Alright. First off, this review is SPOILER FREE. Second, this is as of chapter 390, so I feel I have a good enough feel of the story, since as of this moment, 390 is the most recent chapter. Thirdly, there's two parts to this review. One will be my personal opinion. The other will be facts based around the 5 sets of stars you judge on when making reviews. First, the writing quality is really good. I don't notice many grammatical errors or spelling mistakes. And the few that I do, don't disrupt the flow of the story, or break the immersion. Earlier on there might have been more, but I can't remember. Though nowadays it seems like there's none at all. Speaking of earlier on to nowadays, the story development has been amazing. It's not too fast paced, nor to slow. It's well balanced with the arcs. While there are time skips, they're short bursts rather than years at a time. So the flow is nice, and smooth. Now on to Character Design! The characters are all full of life. They have their own emotions, and stories. They're incredibly detailed and don't all seem the same. They don't seem like extras, or side characters. They aren't disposable, nor forgettable. They have depth, and they matter! I'm sure you'll find yourself loving many of them. While some you may relate to. This one's shorter. Update stability. It's good. Only hiccup recently was a small dip in chapters a week because the Author was hospitalized, but they're okay now! Finally, World Background! This, in my opinion is phenomenal. The power levels, the creatures, the phasing of our world as we know it, and the other side. The attention to detail of even the smaller things just adds more life a realness to the story. I find myself often not having enough details in a story to completely immerse my mind into the world I'm trying to see, but in this story.. In this story it's as if a movie is playing in my mind. I guess this is the really ""Finally"". My opinion. This story has quickly become a top 3 to top 5 of mine on this app. At least, of novels I've read on this app in particular. Not including other sites. I have a top 20 chart in my notepad app on my phone that is densely packed with completed stories I've read. However, it wouldn't be fair to compare those like ""The King's Avatar"", or ""Coiling Dragon"" to this one, as it's not done. Though with the way it's going, I could see it surpassing those ones, even if that's only in my heart. So.. this would definitely be in my top 3 to top 5 of ONGOING stories. If you read all of this, I hope you have a wonderful day! And if YOU have read this Author-san, thank you for this fantastic world that I've fallen in love with. <3",1111623348
1.98115E+16,4311652505,Bread23312,4,just a short review for one of my favorite books. I had a couple points where I wasn't sure about the book early on but the author does an amazing job of moving on from these and making an excellent story.when your plot is backed around a weak orphan mc I can see why you are forced to make connections for him early on to get out of that pit which others complain about but it is more realistic and flows better. nobody gets to a better point without some fortunate encounters so what you call forced can just be seen as good fortune that's how I choose to see it. Now my feelings about the MC are simple I like how smart and loyal he is and his morals I can't wait to find out more to see how I feel about the whole rules thing but I don't mind it so far. I am sure it is hard on author as well to write a MC that can't lie. lol. overall the story is amazing and I couldn't ask for more.,1116550002

1.98115E+16,4318865282,ctleans,3,"140 chapters-ish in. If it does get better right after that I wouldn't know because I don't plan to continue reading. This does contain a bit of spoilers but it is only for mostly early chapters and it breaks the formatting so I won’t be marking it as such. This story did not give me the ""kick"" I have found in the stories I have read so far. By the 140th chapter, a reader can be expected to be hooked, to be immersed in the world enough to see the developments of the story as familiar. However, up to this point, the plot has been largely unamusing, confusing, and often inconsistent. I - Plot holes This is not going to be a full on critique of realisticness, as that isn't a necessity of an engaging story. One big problem I have with the setting is the lack of *practical* technology. The story likes to use the excuse of the presence of monsters as a magical way to disregard technology. You can't launch satellites sure but mobile devices and internet have no need for satellites. They are facilitated by cell towers which shouldn't be that hard to build. Theo getting assassinated is a plot hole because mobile devices should exist, and he could just make some call to emergency services to protect himself. Unless... of course, they were out of range. In that case, where are the vehicles? There are vehicles (humvees) designed to traverse hazardous environments. Now all of this could be avoided by providing some more petty excuses which I would happily accept, but as of now, there are none. A suggestion for the story: just abandon the whole ""separate world with monsters but no technology"" gimmick altogether. Also try giving a gun to your weak characters. If a gun is ineffective against weak monsters, and a weak character is able to kill a weak monster, then a gun is ineffective against weak characters? It's guns work or they don't. How about a tank? A nuclear bomb? There's a limit to how much ""weapons are weak against monsters so we must use medieval era weapons"" you can put in a story with future tech like a Sky.. net.. web.. link? I forgot. Additional nitpicks: The couple at the start of the story talking about how they MURDERED someone in public? You had to be a genius to attain hero rank but now Theo is supposed to do it in 3 months and it is suddenly a normal and easy thing to do? Theo is a genius now because he's picking ""le breathing and l'awareness"" easily but when did he become a genius... how? ...and other plot holes stated in other reviews I won't bother plagiarizing. II - Writing It doesn't need to be said that the english on this site is... not exactly up to the standards you would find in an normal english book. From the few other stories I have read so far, very often there are grammatical errors present. I do commend the author for not having as much grammatical errors and using more ""formal"" vocabulary. However, the underlying nitpick I have is the ""flow"" of the story. The story all too often has the need to explain something that the reader already knows. You can remind them using dialogue. It's also a bit awkward to straight up give information to the reader. You can find this in the form of internal monologues, specifically where Theo contemplates a decision (there is a lot of this going on) that doesn't need to be written out because it's not that important to the story besides a few sentences. More critique from a kid failing his english class: NEVER use contractions and informal speak (swearing) in narration. This is fine if the narrator is part of the story, but not in this one. Also try refraining from doing the inverse— using formal vocabulary in casual dialogue. ""I will shamelessly utilize this opportunity"" - It's awkward. III - Story/World Is it that I (try to) read too fast, I get distracted too easily, I'm not paying enough attention, or all of the above? The story is really hard to follow. Why does Theo pick Laust? He knows Laust resents him but he picks him anyways and is surprised when Laust doesn’t want to fight. The fight scenes are hard to follow as well. It gets even more confusing when you pit 5 against 5 and you have to visualize: person 1-10 are in their respective positions but then person 1 moves in front of person 6 and their CLONE is magically behind person 9 and is about to attack person 7 when person 4 intercepts… The power system is a weird mix between levels, skills, “awareness,” and “experience.” It really does start out with levels, but then each additional factor is added and it becomes really a “You can get X easily but what you really need is Y.” Additionally I don't consider this particularly fast paced despite the tag, this is actually the primary reason I dropped the novel. In the last 2 novels I have read, by now the character has: surpassed their bullies by a huge margin, finished exacting their revenge, discovered a new conspiracy about death/disappearance of family/friends, triggered a hidden power in their inner self that scares everyone, and is now on a quest for further vengeance. I apologize if I just spoiled every novel that exists and will exist on this site, but yeah, the pacing is not that fast. IV - Character(s) I think beyond the archetypes of bullies, girlfriends, and mentors, the story fails to portray Theo as a likeable protagonist. In the first few chapters Theo is weak (as usual) but then gets betrayed. Note he says one of those cliche ""humans are evil and something something I want to purge them all."" The story then forgets all about it in the next 100 chapters or so and doesn't seem to have any intention of bringing that back again. He is able to level up faster though levels supposedly don't matter that much. Besides that, what is special about him? He's smart and able to come up with plans and outsmart his peers? I'd have to disagree, it's more like the other characters are dumber. 'Ah yes you stole my kill so now I am scared and I feel like you have control over me' - what? What is so special about his clone skill? So he doesn’t have friends? What is so special about leveling up his skills? How is that “cheating the system?” I think the story is poorly thought out and the writer really intended on making things up along the way while forgetting the details made early on.

1.98115E+16,4313836833,ForceRecon,2,"I've read around 200 chapters at this point to keep giving it another chance but the more I read the more I'm disappointed, this isn't 'God of Trickers', it's 'World of Low Standards'. Theo, the MC, will play dead and his enemies will go ""OH MY GOD, WHAT A GENIUS, UNBELIEVABLE, HOW COULD SOMEONE BRILLIANT EVER BE BORN IN THIS WORLD, I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING"". MC will do some ridiculously basic strategy a 13 or 14 year old could come up with, probably younger since they play so much games these days and you don't know what they're exposed to but then someone will go ""MY GOD, A GENIUS, A GENIUS, HOW COULD HE BE SO BRILLIANT!"" MC will reflect after a battle with his teammates and they'll go ""MY GOD, HE'S THINKING 100 YEARS AHEAD, REFLECTION!?!!??!? WE CAN DO THAT!???????? OMG, WE CAN THINK ON OUR FAULTS!?!?!?!??!? THEO YOU MADMAN, YOU GENIUS"" If we go by DC comics and their ""Genius level intellect"" for the most intelligent beings then MC has ""Low level intellect"", he's capable of coming up with thoughts a normal person might have but the world overreacts because the standards are so absurdly low I'm not really keeping a list to go over specifics but by chapter 200 you'll have noticed that the standards for the world are low Also, levels in this novel have no meaning whatsoever, I'm not even sure why they were added I really did try hard to enjoy this novel but I agree with other reviews that there are a lot of glaring issues with this and I don't doubt them that their are plenty of plotholes that will rear their heads if you continue reading There are no tricks here, they literally call anything a trick Dogs could be called tricks for the relevance of the word in this novel",1111624241
1.98115E+16,4301063463,ResidentialPsycho,3,"God of Tricksters is an action/adventure/mystery series about Theo, who becomes blessed by the God of Mischief. However, these concepts are inconsistent with the early story. Rather than creating mischief or performing tricks, Theo relies heavily on strategy. He specializes in outwitting his opponents and controlling the battlefield. For some reason, characters in this series refer to such strategy as “tricks,” even though this doesn’t make sense in English. Hundreds of chapters later, this improves, and Theo begins to incorporate a little mischief into some of his actions, but it’s still quite low for what I would expect from the follower of the God of Mischief. The actual “tricks” he performs are skills with magic. They are literally called “skills.” In fact, it is more accurate to refer to them as skills or techniques rather than tricks. While Theo definitely tricks and deceives his opponents, he doesn’t necessarily perform “tricks” to do so. This may be a subtlety in the English language where the verb and the noun don’t exactly have the same meaning. Unfortunately, this makes the title of the series rather awkward when put with the rest of it. The emphasis of “tricks” in the narrative doesn’t match the context much of the time either. There are numerous other grammatical and vocabulary issues with the English language, such as “female cowboy” being used rather than “cowgirl,” the confusion between a house and a mansion (a place that is only 2,500 sq ft is way too small to be a mansion), and so on. There are also a lot of gender inconsistencies. An editor who knows English as a first language would help this series substantially. The writing can be confusing at times, partially due to the writing of English itself and partly due to leaving important details out. There area number of things that don’t make sense in the initial setting, and there are plot details and consequences that don't make sense later on. Just because Theo cheated a group out of a fruit, why are the person who initially provoked him and his father being imprisoned for life? If they were cheated, then wouldn't they just sue to get what they're owed? The characters have depth with their own goals and enemies, and their character development makes sense. The unnatural hair colors are a little confusion. Just how many characters have dyed their hair pink or blue in this story? The setting wasn’t established very clearly, so it is very confusing for new readers in the beginning. The MC lives in a poor country where the wealthy and powerful have no concern for the law. People don’t look after the welfare of children, don’t manage bullying, and don’t care if a child is on the side of the road starving to death. Instead of reporting the kid to the authorities to be taken into foster care or juvenile detention, they just beat these dying kids half to death and leave them to rot. It’s quite strange and would have helped substantially if the author explained this in the beginning. That said, the writing improves a lot as it goes. Later in the series, there are interesting action and adventure scenes linking up together at an interesting pace, so I would recommend giving this series a try and being patient with it.",1116547691

Your looking at a MC that will slap someone on the wrist for crossing him, and only kill those that try to kill him and are significantly weaker than him. Boring in my opinion. Side charcters are similar to the MC they have some depth to them but overall way to generic, and lighthearted.

The MC felt detached from humanity, and the connection between their reincarnation and the system's existence lacked interest. The romance was atrocious and unnatural, while the author's portrayal of teachers revealed a lack of understanding.

Sure! Yea go for it. Attacks and slaughters a garrison full of men where the author goes into great detail about an underdog character with a great character and an unborn child with a loving wife at home? Sure...? lil weird but go for it. Attacks and slaughters a slave caravan that was attacking a village? Yeaaa!!! No problems here- wait your slaughtering the villagers too? Innocent woman abt the be r-ped? Kill her! Slaves chained in a wagon? Kill them all!, 3 dark elves with an older sister and 2 younger twins that the older sisters very protective over? Kill her- wait but plot armour says you cant because of a curse on them... Cripple the older sister! The plot continues on like this becoming darker and darker and not even an enjoyable dark. Unless you are mentally unhinged, I don't really see the appeal in reading a story that humanizes the victims before killing them only to try and portray the main character as some sort of human happy mind with positive innuendoes in his self-dialogue.

He's not a reincarnated human he's a human who got every single memory wiped and all his emotions erased like a normal person when getting turned into a undead. The only thing he has is intelligence that he uses well considering he's barely 3 years old at chapter 225. Don't worry about his age since he's 2 meters tall. He has the endless hatred every undead posses to the living and no human morals since, you guess it. He's a undead. He will kill children, woman, men, and anything that breaths if they don't give any thing worthy for him to use and even then they probably won't live. EVERY SINGLE character has a backstory and is fleshed out ""Human"". The people he kills all have personalities and traits that make them unique and I love that. You actually see the fear and sadness of the people who die and can relate to their struggles. In my opinion this is the best non human Mc I've ever read about, and I've read thousands of books on this site.

If your looking for a story with consistently good grammar, leave now. To be frank this needs to be revised heavily as at points I am completely unable to decipher what’s trying to be said. However I will say that at times nice vocabulary the author utilizes leaves me puzzled as to how so many simple grammatical errors can be made (perhaps English isn’t their first language?). Nevertheless it’s still completely readable for the most part and has kept me interested thus far (ch 63). In terms of story the beginning was Simplistic yet fun with a somewhat fresh take on a system that wasn’t super OP right from the get go, yet provides the tools necessary to progress without any real plot armor. In addition the author does a great job of staying true to the MC’s hate for humanity while also not going over the top all the time. Seeing his restraint develop was very well done and makes his brutality all the better when restraint isn’t necessary. Looking forward, depending on how a set couple of characters are developed will decide on whether or not this story is truly a cut above the rest.

None of that is happening. The story in the beginning is a little basic but as you keep reading it it becomes more and more complex. This story has stakes and the mc grows with every decision he makes because there are consequences and he WILL make bad decisions because he dosent know jacksh#t about anything and has to find out through those bad choices and learn from mlhis mistakes. Overall it is a GREAT novel with good writing, story and characters. The only things bad about this work are the grammer and update stability.

It's really hard not to have some similar plot points or tropes in writing with so many lns and such. I can't really find a lot of fault with that. There are some serious issues with spelling and grammar enough that I am assuming english is not your first language. That's not meant to be a jab, but I do suggest finding someone to edit your chapters. I'm not far enough yet to really judge the development of the world as a whole. I will say it seems odd to include the MC being killed by terrorists and then making him a souless killer through the rest. Obviously, I get it with him being undead and unfeeling it could make sense, it just feels odd. Unless it becomes a trope later with him regaining his memory and such, but I don't know how well that'd play out. Overall, I'm enjoying the read and look forward to more. The only major demerits are the grammatical and spelling errors. They can be grating at times and really hurt the flow of the story.",1111624161

In the chapter the “Star beast vs. Tiger Demons” the author sort of explains what the are...individually but not how they are related. Then a few chapters later he expounds some more, only for a few chapters later to really iron out that Star beast who control humans (are known as tiger demons) vs. humans who control Star beast (known as Star pets)…took you long enough to say that… From roughly a few chapters past that, maybe after the beast god sect is destroyed. This novel takes a HUGE nationalist tone!! Essentially the author (still using real world country names), says anyone not part of the nine provinces (China) are barbarians, and that China will always be number one. This continues until the MC says hey America is know for stealing peoples stuff, so I’ll copy their stuff, give it to my country so they can profit from their stuff, and America should be grateful that we took their stuff and made improvements to it… So yeah probably not going to continue to read this novel…",1111624220

2.13449E+16,4301046687,Salty_Biscuit,2,It starts out okay with an intresting premise but it’s ruined by the nationalism. I’m guessing the author got in trouble for not having enough nationalism so he went overboard. A character who is a foreigner is suddenly stated to have seven-eigths bloodline from the nine provinces (China) out of nowhere. Im guessing this might be because having a genius not from China is a big no-no. It later states this is why the headmaster accepted him as a student and he wouldn’t have otherwise. The main charcter’s feats are repeatedly stated to show how glorious they were with 5000 years of history. This is mentioned so many times I usually just skim a few paragraphs when it comes up. The patriotism would be fine if it weren’t for the author degrading other countries to make China seem superior.,1111624175

2.13449E+16,4313885151,Milak_Peter,2,"To be honest, I found this novel pretty good at the beginning, but it went downhill very fast. I still perseviered until chapter 180+, but then I gave up. One point is indeed the massive nationlism, which would not be too bad as most chinese novels have a good amount. The main issue is that in this novel its unbearable for me. (note that I am not from the US) The other thing is the MC whose character is all over the place, like there is not one, but at least 10 different people. His thinking is massively different then the background story show us. He is someone who spent most of his live (or thats how it seems) in hospital bad and then dies. He missed many things in life. He also said he wants to enjoy his new life the fülledt, he do not want to die. That could generate a cowardly MC, with possible character development as time goes on. But that is not the case. The MC is doing nothing, that could count as enjoying life. No traveling, getting friends, partying, or (god forbid) getting a woman. He does nothing at all, except reading, eating and sleeping. That what the hospital should have looked like no? Time to time the author tries to throw us some bones like, ""I am handsome, I have time to have a girfriend"", but not actively looking for a woman and avoiding woman as a plague is 2 very different things. Also he is inconsistent in his decisions without any narrative why did he make those. The characters are all over the place, not well thought out and empty most of the time. The writing itself is far from bad and there is a semi-decent world building as well, but most of the time I think the author is at most 10-12 years old with no life experience at all. And my biggest problem is that I absolutely can not relate to the MC in any way. Not with his thinking, decisions and most of the time not even his plans, other then wanting to become stronger. At the end he is an idiotic child with a massive strenght. The worst kind.",1111623360

He is now charging 12-13 stones per new chapter (up from 4/Ad watch) and he is still only releasing 1 chapter a day. Other premium series tend to at least release 2-4 on a consistent daily basis.

1.92461E+16,4314702898,okaykaykay,5,"I cannot believe I waited this long to read this book. I added it to my reading list a couole of months ago because the plot sounded interesting, but I thought it was a typical werewolf book (and that genre is something I’m not really drawn to). So, I didnt read it until last week. And IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It gripped me from the very first chapter! I could not “put the book down” until I was caught up with everything. This book has love, drama, tastefully written love scenes, suspense, and more! I fell in love with all the characters in the book, especially the ML and the FL and their love for each other. The ML is a very strong and dominant character, yet very tender and loving. I also like that he has a very strong sense of what is right and wrong. The FL isn’t a dominant but I like how she sticks to her beliefs, and values even in the face of death, and living in a new world. But, she also tries to respect, and understand the new culture thrust upon her. So happy I found this book and author. I love her writing style. She pulls you into this world and makes you feel how each of the characters feel. She builds this wonderful world, and sets the pace of the story wherein it doesn’t feel rushed but also doesn’t feel drawn out. It’s a great little escape from the real world 😊 I cannot wait to see what happens!! I already know this is one of my favorite books because I’ve already started re-reading it😆 And while I wait for the updates, it’s time to expore her other books. I know I won’t be disappointed. P.S. I don’t know who cares about grammatical errors, but I do especially when reading something. The book probably has a few but I don’t really remember them, which means I wasn’t stopping, and editing/correcting things in my head while reading. So not only is the book amazing in the sense of its content, but it’s also a very easy, and smooth read 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽",1111623964

1.92461E+16,4301979848,Karedelune,5,"I was going to wait until I knew more of the story (I’m less than 30 chaps in) but I keep writing comments that are way too long so clearly I’m already too involved emotionally. My review might sound bad at first, but bear with me, it’s not. So far I like Elia, she’s taking all the shit thrown at her like a champ. Reth is still on probation, but it’s only because I fear his kingly duties might force him into some poor decisions. As a man, he’s been nothing but sweet and respectful and hot, really hot. I’m really looking forward to how their romance unfolds. I think that part will be amazing and sweet. I hate everyone else! Of course that’s because I’m completely empathising with Elia as the author intends, and so far the only good thing that’s happened to her is that Reth is a good man, who understands human ways enough to show her respect in a way she understands. I’m still waiting for someone else to show a slither of sympathy to Elia. It’s only been a day in the story, so I’m hopeful. The reason for my hatred is simple: beautifully maintained world building. The Anima have a culture that is utterly foreign, and they make no excuses for it. They have their ways, and Elia (along with the reader) is expected to keep up. And the whole experience rubs me the wrong way. Elia’s own human ways are ignored by most, and that denial of her is painful to me. To the point that I need to make long comments where I complain about how they treat her. So yeah, so far it’s a painful if interesting read, but mostly it’s painfully real. Because it’s what culture shock feels like when you’re alone and scared. And I’m really impressed that the writter can ellicit such a raw feeling in me. Honestly this just shows how good of a story this will be. Because a book that can make the reader feel strongly both good and bad emotions, has the potential to be great.",1111623183

1.92461E+16,4311410474,alpha_sierra,4,"Ooo I like this one a lot!! For me the most alluring aspect of this novel is the dynamic between the characters. There is so much potential in each of them and in how Reth and Elia will grow and develop together. The author characterizes them so well it's almost as if I can feel their aura through the text. Hmm I would describe the writing style so far as mesmerizing. Then again, I feel like my appreciation of Reth's nature (gotta love a respectful mans) skews my opinion of the story a bit. The air of mystery, or perhaps the intrigue of the unknown, contributes to the charm of the story in my opinion. Also it’s probably just me getting too lost in the story, but I somehow feel undercurrents of primal nature in the tone of the story. Again it’s probably just me being me. I will say though that the world building part of the story is a bit overwhelming. But I must also mention that the overwhelming feeling magnifies how Elia must have been feeling in her situation. Plus my brain was simply unprepared to envision such a vibrant, detailed world. All that being said, I truly enjoy this novel and look forward to how it will progress. (Oh also I haven’t read any of the author’s other works, but I must give them kudos and appreciation for what I’ve read so far. Much love!!)",1111546448

1.27916E+16,4300405349,Swaning,5,"If you have read the author's other work ""Mr. Tycoon's Daring Wife"", then you know what you can expect from this novel. I have not read this novel before it went on hiatus and when the author decided to continue writing this story, we were informed that the plot was slightly revised. Perhaps for the first 50 or so chapters, there might be people who are able to provide some spoilers due to prior knowledge of the chapters before they were taken down for editing and revision. But as the story develops further, I can tell that the plot is not as predictable as it seems and would keep you guessing what's going to happen next. Now that makes an exciting and interesting read right? Writing quality: Great. 👍 Clear sentences, sound grammar. The author pays great attention to details and you would be able to find many examples of beautiful and vivid descriptions in the story—from the character's physique to their clothes, their emotions to their actions, and their surrounding environment adds so much depth to the story and makes it enjoyable to read. These details were so well-written that it allow readers to picture the entire scene in our minds. Updating stability: The author is working hard to give us daily updates. Creation is hard and given that the author is still schooling, I can't, in my good conscience, demand daily updates, more chapters or mass releases. I hope fellow readers could be understanding and be patient to wait for updates even when there might be no updates on some days or even over a period of time. Story development: The story is developing well in my opinion, not too fast, not too slow. This is a female lead story and the title of the novel couldn't be any clearer as to where this story is headed. There are lots of mysteries waiting to be unravelled and the biggest mystery of all at this point as I'm writing this review (as of ch86) is the identity of the male lead that still remains unknown. I can't wait to find out! Character design: There are many of characters in this story and I think the author is doing a good job in building her characters. They are not just names, but the author gives enough descriptions to give us an understanding of their personality, character and values. It makes you feel like you actually know the character as a person, forming a connection to the characters. My favourite characters in the story are the members of the Li Family and I can confidently say that they are the universal favourites. World background: This is the first novel I'm reading that is set in the historical period and it's refreshing, a break from all the modern romance novels that I've been reading. As I'm reading the story, I feel like I'm transported back to the past, no doubt because of the author's writing prowess. I think having watched Chinese period dramas before in the past helped me in my imagination of the story. In conclusion, this novel is definitely worth a read! 👍😁 I'm glad I picked this up and I'm enjoying the journey!",1111624051

She is mentally strong without being too unrealistic. Although the beginning was a bit common (MC being betrayed by her lover and stepsister) but I actually felt pain for the MC.

Their personalities keep on changing with new information or event. Xueyue’s feelings also fluctuate going from the first guy to the second and there is no good reason why her feelings would change so drastically and so firmly.

However, i hope you will be able to enjoy this story despite its shortcomings. Here are a few more informations about this novel. I read many webnovels, from eastern/ western fantasy, to apocalypse stories, with System and Video-games sub-genre from time to time. After reading so much, i have developed a vision quite precise of what i'm seeking for in a story. The start of this story is slow, with maybe too many info blocks in the first few chapters, but it will only improve after. Survival, System and Apocalypse are the dominant themes. However, you will find at some point similarities (but very different in the facts) with other webnovels like Devil's Cage, Terror infinity and Ultimate evolution. The difference is that it will only be one aspect of the story. There is one central Romance, no Harem. There will potentially be several love interests in the story, but as in real life we meet people and things happen or not. As a Survival story, there is a Game of Throne/ Walking Dead feel that can't be avoided. Not everyone can survive but the deaths are not distributed like candies either. At last, i attach a lot of importance to coherence. If you notice any incoherences, don't hesitate to point it out. It will be quickly fixed.",1111623255

The writing quality is excellent, surpassing the best Qidian has to offer and is up at the top with the likes of Supreme Magus and The Lord of the Mysteries (it’s been a long time since I’ve had to look up the definition of a word and it is an exciting prospect with this book). The story/world building is intriguing, reminiscent of Terror Infinity in premise but with its own uniqueness which makes it captivating to read. The characters are interesting as the author does his/her best to replicate all the human intricacies. I hope that this review will serve as encouragement for the author and other readers to persevere with this story; the only reason it is not in the top 15 is because not many know of it (surpasses plenty of the garbage up there like My Vampire System for example).

Set in a dystopian world where the inhabitants of earth are transferred to, everyone is left to fend for themselves. Not only do the people have to worry about monsters, the fight for power and survival amongst humans and alien cohabitants requires everyone to watch their backs. However, everyone is equipped with a powerful AI system called the Oracle and it up to the individual how to make the best use of it. The story is very well-written and the plot is quite compact. The start is a bit slow but once the action starts the novel becomes unputdownable. The progression of the character is quite slow if you compare it to other novels of the same genre but that doesn't make it even a tad uninteresting. Each setting is vivid and enjoyable and the story is never a drag. The characters each have a distinct personality. The growth of the characters' personalities border real world people making them lifelike. The chapter length is quite good, and although there is a single release daily, the chapter is a big one.

First of all the world building is very well made, it has similarities with the ultimate evolution. Nevertheless it's original, has a lot of potential and it's slowly but steadily presented. There's a long introduction delving a lot into the mc's personality and worldview. For some people maybe that's a reason not to read it. For me it wasn't boring at all. I could even empathise with him occasionally. The explanations and building of his personality maybe were were a bit rough and forced in some cases, but it didn't make it unpleasant and the author said he would improve his first chapters so maybe this will not me the case in some weeks. I am not a native speaker, I found some small and not important mistakes, but not many and they didn't make my reading experience bad. All in all I would definitely recommend it! Let's just hope that the author keeps this high release rate and quality :)",1115858942

All I have are praises for the book and small things in some chapter that I feel can be improved or I don’t understand are mostly in the comments so I think this book is only going to get better..",1111623747

The mc is not cliche and has a real personality and furthermore he is not flawless. He is an introvert but in reality he wants to socialise with others. _Writing Quality_ The writing quality is pretty good and there are very few mistakes (I am not an englsih native speaker so you probably will find more than I though). _Stability of Updating_ The author posts a day, but sometimes he misses a day but makes up for it in the later days. _Story Developpment_ It has to be said that this is a slow story but as soon as he ~Spoiler~ enters the new world the progress is normal. It is clear that the author has an idea for the plot and the story follows a clear ""path"" _Character Design_ The characters are all interesting and have their own flaws. Even though you can guess the personality of a character, there are some plot twists which seem understandebal but unexpected. ~Spoiler~ Additionally you can see how the MC fights his asocial personality and socalises more and more -World Backround_ The world has a clear structure and there is nothing that happens, that seems totally random. The wolrd is furthermore intresting and you want to know more abou it. All in all it is a fun read and you should give it a try.

I am always longing for a new chapter and get dissapointed if there is no chapter that day.

The story has a lot of potential but the author doesn't develops mc's character so it is good only when you read it to pass time. The story is extremely well defined. It has nice world development and very good power system.

Personally, while I have read a lot of novels, their is not much degree of ""surprise"" in them...I mean the mc follows a pattern he follows; which looks good at the start but becomes dull after some time. the reason I love this novel is because it is full of ""SURPRISES"". Mc is in the unknown, tackles difficulty after difficulty, getting rewards and his life is full of ""ADVENTURE"", this is one of the best things about this novel that many novels are lacking and their Mc is like a robot following a pathetic script which is usually dull, boring, empty and without purpose and Aims....while some have aims but they are not so grand or the mc does not follow them. And the other thing that's unique about your novel are the ""CHARACTERS"" I MEAN Wow their are a ton lot of characters shown in the chapters and NONE among them are ordinary....all of them are unique, have their backstories, feelings, aims, struggles and all of them are trying their best with their own powers....Author just imaging how much work you would have put just to think of their names are beyond me😅😅😅 but you have connected them with the story, showing great emotions and actions with realistic results...For that you have my utter and super RESPECT Author. And the last thing that I am gonna say is about ""DIVERSITY""...about all the stuff that you have put in the novel is truly and magnificently Unique and DIFFERERNT... Firstly invasion and traveling the cosmos and finding new things and meeting awesome and making no sense ALIENS, with a super unique system that not only the Mc has but everyone does...this show some of the fairness and shows MC is not winning because of some simply cheat and even if he gets stronger and stronger, their are things totally beyond him which he aim to overcome....This is what i am talking about...your novel World Background is sooo big and infinite....with a new concept of ENEMIES and long distances and so on and on. I think I have wrote a decent long paragraph but it still does not show the great and awesome points of the novel...Author your novel is really good...and I know your are proud of it...I really would like it if each of your chapter is amazing and filled adventure and MAINLY Gives the readers a lot of CURIOSITY...I would be very satisfied and wish you never drop this novel and may this novel reach more than 10,000 chapters😁😁😁😁with never ending adventure...I will be very happy....and ofcourse The suggestion I have are many and but the only one I must say are that other than Digesters,.... some other intelligent, giant and colossal enemies should be prepared for the Mc...or like beings like Cosmos deities and what not...Personally I like huge, overpowered monsters😆😆😆😆 with beautiful Art My best wishes are with you author...stay healthy and safe...and complete the novel thank you.😅 😂 🤣 This is the review from me...hope you get something from this",1116552998

The first major antagonist alone crafted a plot I did not see coming till the last minute and i had to admit was actually really smart and creative.

I have to say that this is one of my most fav novel. It was an amazing piece of work and it felt realistic. I read this very long ago but I still have a pretty good impression of it. Mc died a tragic death and the trauma was so bad that even when was reborn, it took a toll on her. But she schemed quite smartly using her past life knowledge and lessons she learned and went thru, it wasn’t easy and that’s why I said it felt realistic but it was a great adventure. ML was quite a fun and scheming character too. As far as I remember, there was one time skip in this novel which enhanced the plot. Overall, I would say that this isn’t a light-hearted novel, but it depends on the reader how to take it and enjoy it as you’ll get both the laugh and tears from it; it definitely was one of the best for me and I would recommend reading it.😊",1162141465

I have so many novels in my reading list but are left at 40 chapters because it's been dropped. But all these novels were in the 'trial read' so obviously webnovel had thought they had potential.

1.8132E+16,4311834034,MonarchRavioli,4,"Review after 868 chapters This is book is fantastic as a lover of history and fantasy this is a unique twist on the story of Merlin. I plan to use in this review the overall pacing, upload/community, grammer and punctuation. #1 Pacing: Personally believe that this book has some fantastic pacing, as a weak to strong genre it showcases a real struggle for Merlin, he has his ups ans his downs and we can feel his struggle throughout the book as he continues life gets that little easier and that little harder. Everything has a purpose and there are long payoffs for those who pay attention. If you like mythology and history, you'll pick up tid bits which you'll really enjoy, many moments left me in a case of picking my jaw from the floor. #2 Upload Schedule and Community Avans has a great upload schedule he releases very frequently with usually two a day which is great. He keeps to his promises in regards to bonus chapters for golden ticket ranking and overall ranking pushes. The community is one of the best I've ever encountered, everyone is kind and friendly and the author does monthly quiz's and voucher giveaways in which he personally runs and he's very active in the chat, watching us theorise while he watching with bated breath. #3 Grammar and Punctuation: Throughout the book there is very little in regards to problems, Avans is very on the ball, fixes where possible and everything is just as perfect as you can hope. So to summerize some Pros and Cons Pros World Building is, in a word, magical The magic system is very interesting and easy to understand. The use of Bloodlines is also very unique and special in regards to its use and importance. The pacing is just about right not to fast and not too slow Will leave you wanting more and you will grow with Emery on his journey Cons some of the characters can feel 2 dimensional to begin with but they become fleshed out as the story progresses Many find problems with the romance at the end of the day its not the main focus but its a tool towards Emerys emotional growth and its still important, plus we have fun debates. The cliffhangers are killer, they're great but I hate them. You won't regret reading this book I personally binged the first 110 chapters in one night. I'm sure you will too.",941529397

I loved watching the MCs personality change from a young teen stuck with romantic issues taking on challenges he wasn’t prepared for to a grown adult capable of putting the greater planetary-scale interests before his own personal affairs. The early chapters may be a bit hard to read but if you put yourself in the MCs shoes during your hormonal years, I’m sure you will be able to relate to his issues. The overall plot is much more serious and bigger than the MC and so it’s worthwhile to stick to the book and keep reading. You won’t regret it. The writing quality has improved by leaps and bounds over the course of the book and the story is not very predictable making you wait to see how things actually turn out.

The series starts off rough but by the second volume it really finds its footing and starts heating up. It’s always had strongly written characters but they really started developing towards the end of the end of the first volume and I couldn’t put it down. I see a lot of negative comments when reading but I just can’t understand them, you can really feel the love the author has for writing and the characters and that is what makes for a good novel. If you tried this series before but decided to drop it I really recommend picking it back up because you are missing out my friend.

1.8132E+16,4301453315,CanYouMakeItClear,4,"(My Honest Review😁) The MC starts off slow and his progress in Magic is minimal, But, now that I think of it, I enjoyed it. The process of the MC's, little by little improvement, until he gets stronger, is a slow and enjoyable ride. It's like when you ride a Ferris Wheel and peek outside, seeing a great view, slowly and surely unfold on your eyes. It may be because of me being Fan of a slow start, not like most of the Novels here in WN, being fast-paced and OP. (A quick summary without leaking any major spoilers) Earth is not exactly the ""Earth"" we know, but an Earth with a slight tweak with some new species and special people. 85 BC Earth, so yeah. Let's start with the World Building… I'm speechless. Start with Earth, and he, the MC miraculously gets transported to a place where People would learn Magic. Emery is a Human, but not really, as his Mother being *spoiler*. The Kingdom is an enemy to Emery's mother Kind and when they know his secret, they chase him, getting his Father killed, and him miraculously escaping the chase, and miraculously got transported to Magus Academy. Magus Academy is a place or Holy Land of some sort for Mages. Emery is a rare Human who had 4 Elements for him to choose from, but his talent being B, the worst talent in his class. He needs to pass the test or his memory might be erased and be transported back to Earth, but getting back means Death for him. (Summary Ends) The thing I like about this Novel is the World Building or the description the author is putting for us to see. 5 stars World Building. I see that most of the readers didn't like how slow-paced the story is, but for me, it is perfect. 5 stars Story Development.  Writing Quality is 4.8 stars, because of some typos, but it will not affect your reading Tbh.  Update? Waiting… as there are some personal problems the Editor is facing, so the Author can't publish the Chapter. 4.5 stars...🙃 Character Design is 4.8. The People are flesh out fine, and you can clearly feel the emotions they want us to feel. But not that clear sometimes, or it is me just being dumb?🤣 Overall 4.8! Great Novel with a Huge Potential!  *The way I see it(chapter 36) The story's MC is like an MC who will, or most of the time be an underdog. So you guys must be patient!🤣 *Comment your thoughts🤣 or questions🤔",941529799

Its a slow start, i know the trending novel are currently a fireworks from the start. OP item or skill, etc. This one is a classic weak to strong novel. Even i dont really like the MC at the start. But i assure you it will change. 2. As much as it said historical, its not really true. It based on real world history but its still a fiction novel, so hope you enjoy the alternate earth. 3. The world and characters are the one i am confident with. i took a lot of time on them, but you can be the judge of that. 4. The grammer and writing stability should improve much from my last novel as i have more experience now. But please be forgiving if there still some mistake, as english is my second language. Please give the novel a try and hope you can enjoy the adventure of Emery and how he became the earth's greatest magus.",941545699

I can already see character development in the future, unique magic spells and a lot more. This book is speaking to me. Telling me details without even reading about them. It's amazing. Writing Quality: I'm hungarian so I can't tell much.... That's what I would say about average novels with good writing style, but this novel is unique. Even I can tell that the writing quality is good. The author knows his/her way with the words. Story Development: A very good paced story. This is almost like magic to me. As if the author had all the time in the world to think about the story. Only 14 chapters and a lot of things happened, yet the story is not rushed at all. Character Design: It's really colorful. Author gave us almost enough character details. We can imagine the characters, but we can also depend on our minds. Every significant character got a personality here. Update Stability: Currently 7/week. Not the best, but it's not bad either. The novel is good so I'm already thankful. World Background: I can't say much about this one. It's interesting, a mix of imagination and real world. It's a bit hard to explain. Read the novel and you will understand. I won't say much because the novel only started 2 weeks ago. (Currently only 14 chapters. This an early review. I hope the author keeps up the good work. Also, I hope this review helped you understand a bit more about this novel.)",941545130
1.8132E+16,4310147234,SpectralSun,3,"Honestly the story is well written in comparison to many others out there but the Author should really work on his depiction of the main character's character as well as habits and train of thoughts. The way he handles issues is off-putting to say the least. His thought process is irrational and dumb and he tends to make seemingly ""smart"" choices but in depth investigation shows that his choices are actually rather stupid and don't seem progressive. He takes constant loses in dealings and is honestly a character without an ounce of spleen. He can be said to be somewhat of a sycophant and this is till chapter 70 as thats where I reached before nearly puking blood from the frustratiion the mc is causing me. Other than the main character I have loved everything about the novel so far. I highly appreciate the author and would like to encourage him to keep putting out chapters but to also work on this mc's character cause it really prevents people from reading the book when his character is this off putting in the beginning.",941545179

In my opinion, this is an amazing novel with an amazingly rich world-building and interesting characters. The main character isn't overpowered and doesn't have any 'cheat' abilities. Infact beside one advantage he has above most (but not all) he would be considered very average in terms of talent. This slower style of improvement in the mc allows the author to bring out my personal favourite feature of this book, highly interesting world building and side character backgrounds. While I've seen some comments complaining about the story being a bit slow at points I think it isn't a bad trait but infact shows that the author takes his time writing a detailed story instead of trying to pump out more chapters for their own gain.

1.8132E+16,4316716240,TheYeetedYeet,5,"Oops I forgot to review one of my top novels after so long! (At chapter 508) ~ ima make it spicy then ~ Honestly the MC’s character progression is slow but I appreciate that there is a more realistic resistence to change. You cant expect someone to go from strong family values to ruthless killer at a drop of a hat. He does progress though so chill. He isnt super OP or has any hacks/cheats. He has had a lucky encounter but his grind to the top is not smooth sailing at all. His talented friends keep up with him so there isnt a new group of people every arc... thank God for that because its hard Remembering so many names in novels! Also the depth each side character has is amazing and I ended up torn between main plot and wanting more side stories. Harem? No harem? Not sure yet, the author is tight lipped but there is juicy romance! Romance is a very well written subplot but not a dominate theme (yet). Im still not completly backing any ship yet! I will point out that the authors closure/shut down of one love interest was so well done that even though i hated the character it was worth every word i read. She could make a come back though, who knows how they will progress because these characters arent just a one off appearence. Though IRL history does foreshadow a spicy adulterous return. The unique flavour of this novel is its histories, myths and legends written into the plot. I love exploring Earths rich history through the plot while trying to google the history in the background. The undercurrents of the novel and its mysteries are closely tied with the above and make the novel so much more entertaining. So the world building is off the charts. To summaries, there is a reason why this novel is consistently in the top charts and these rankings are not wrong. PS - if you want a ruthless MC with a tragic backstory without the cringe edgelord vibe check out Blood Elf Monarch. Same brilliant character designs and mysterious plot but opposite vibe from this story. It was my first Avan novel too!",941542932

2.02668E+16,1035661574,TheAmbrosius,5,"Despite being over 500 chapters in length you get the feeling the author has barely scratched the surface of what is possible. So even though I'm making this review now I still consider this in the beginning stages. Without further ado, let's begin... WRITING QUALITY: -Overall the quality is legible meaning accurate grammar and sentence structure most of the time. How do you know that your reading is poor? One way is because of the need to read over the text you just read not because of its complexity or depth but because you didn't grasp what the author is trying to convey. You won't need to worry about this. STABILITY OF UPDATES: -The author as far as I can tell never stayed in the double digits for weekly releasing nor dropped below 4 chapters for long if at all. This is a sign showing the author's desire to stick at it for the long run compared to the amount released I find this a better gauge of stability. Basically, the author so far has not given us a reason to doubt. STORY DEVELOPMENT: -The short answer is you always find yourself coming back for more. The longer answer is the beginning you are brought to some of the highest peaks of power which shows the vast gap between where the MC is now and the progress to be made from the bottom. With his dungeon as a center point, you see the characters venture out exploring the world similar to a character in a game bringing color to grey areas. This is a deliberate decision the author has made compared to other stories that have the MCs base of operations move with him while he scales the ladder of power. Neither is inherently better just more of a preference this author shows. -Not only do you see the MC develop the story being the one we follow but also many side characters and future villains scheming in the background giving you a foreshadowing of events to come. Overall great job. CHARACTER DESIGN: -The author does a masterful job of making sure each character is fleshed out so they add to the MC and the greater plot. Everyone close to the MC has a distinct personality, side characters you meet along the way regardless of duration feel like real people, and the villains are good villains in the sense they make you root for the MC and his companions. -Many people who don't like harem have legitimate concerns that those characters will either be useless or take away from the greater plot. You don't need to worry about this because so far the author has eluded to a few potential harem members however the plot demands your full attention so romance is not the center but instead the byproduct of a compelling story you read unfold. -Another concern many readers have is stories that have harem members surrounding the MC lack other companions which works sometimes while other times it leaves the reader wanting. I would say you are given a myriad of companions helping the MC, hindering the MC, and being there to flesh out the world. WORLD BACKGROUND: -As I wrote earlier the beginning does an excellent job of showing how vast the world is and how much potential the author can use to develop the story and characters. As the story progresses the MC is shown more of the world that seems never-ending which reminds me of peeling back the layers of an onion trying to find the nonexistent core. -The background is tied in obvious and mysterious ways to the MC letting you make your own judgments while giving you more bit by bit proving how much and little you really know so far. Overall I can't recommend this novel enough. Give it try if you're looking for quality content.",941545629

2.02668E+16,4313836833,ForceRecon,2,"Interesting enough for a read, great concepts but the execution is bit odd Instead of scaling stat values to a lower range we start with random numbers in the hundreds when stats in the double digits would have done the exact same thing, it's like Diablo 3 stats in a novel where you can reach 1T and it means nothing. The DP system is even more ridiculous, Author thought numbers had to be big to have any meaning when 100DP could have been made to be something extremely difficult to reach. When Irene is introduced the novel becomes much more annoying to read as well, at least 25% of every chapter with her is describing her beauty because we, as readers are too dumb to have understood from the introduction, no, literally every sentence with her has to describe her beauty...I just skip over any areas where I see her name now, occasionally I check back and it's a waste because all I was missing is worthless info about her appearance. Expect to encounter chapters wasting 50% or more detail describing how amazing, mysterious and powerful she is for absolutely no reason other than Author thinks we're all idiots. This novel may as well be a tribute to a woman he likes called Irene. World background seems really interesting though, the only other annoying part is how he introduces characters and names, instead of normal descriptions we get ""HELLO BOBBY, EVIL DRAGON CAT DOG FALCON MAN GODBEAST THE THIRD, TWICE REMOVED, KING OF TOKYO, LORD OF DRAGONS, BREAKER OF CHAINS, MOTHER OF DOGS, LEADER OF BLACK CAT GUILD, MOST RESPECTED ANCIENT BEING"" and equally ridiculous introductions that are somehow supposed to be taken seriously Spelling is good, grammar is decent, that's saying a lot for Webnovel so kudos to Author.

2.02668E+16,1035661574,TheAmbrosius,5,"INITIAL THOUGHTS: -Ive recently caught up again with the chapters I stockpiled and decided that I wanted to give potential readers a window view of this great novel. WRITING QUALITY: -The short answer is Top Quality. -The longer answer is the author has done a great job of keeping the writing understandable using proper grammar structure which for what I call “Original Authors” is something that doesn’t always happen. When this novel plateform first started and for most of it’s inception afterwards you’ve had Chinese authors hiring translators who have a high level of English proficiency. This lead to a quality of content most of us readers got used to and only really noticed with new authors exploded on the platform. Overall 5/5. UPDATING STABILITY: -Consist from beginning to now. Averaging 1 a day or 7 a week it’s much better then many authors who seem to burn out after releasing at least twice that amount. Overall 5/5. STORY DEVELOPMENT: -Anyone who has read a fair amount of novels knows that their isn’t one universal story development. We read many decent to masterful stories with varying plots. What we do know even if we can’t put it into words is when a story progresses badly. This novel happens to fall into the great category. -The Main Character (MC) is transported to a cultivation world with many underlying mysteries that accompany his beginning. Most of the time we stick with the MC seeing his progress while at times be shown other characters that add to the overall world in a way that connects to the MCs progress now or in the far future. This is great for a number of reasons -One is how plot points are not only made in the short term, but also in the long term making many events that were a mystery unfold naturally. So while some plot points seem too distant to connect at first get gradually uncovered showing there deep implications. Two many people introduced in different factions and power levels are having a major effect on the story developing in ways we have yet to understand. -Overall I see great things for the story now and later. 5/5. CHARACTER DESIGN: -Short answer again is great. -The MC is positioned in the world as someone within and outside of it. Living a life as a human before and a demon now is taking the best of both worlds so he becomes someone who can make a impact. Ruthless and kind. Distant to some close to others. Prideful yet humble enough to recognize his faults. One of my top MCs. -Close characters are multi dimensional showing there support for the MC and the greater story development. Slowly but surely we see a group form around the MC each bringing color to what could have been a solitary life. I don’t want to give spoilers, but I’ll say that 2 females closest to the MC each bring out more sides to each other’s character development. Overall 5/5. WORLD BACKGROUND: -Deep and mysterious. The MC is slowly unveiling through his exploration what seems to be a complicated world. Many races known like Demons, humans, and dragons while many more briefly mentioned. Also various Apex wars that have happened for reasons unknown. The list goes on and on leaving wanting more. Overall 5/5.",941529682

Very few minor grammatical mistakes to be seen. While I can’t say much about the stability of uodates as I’ve not caught up completely. I see the updated mark consistently enough on the story to know that it is being written by the so author still. Story has been progressing well. There have been times that I’ve felt it’s been slow and there are other times that it picks up the pace. I am not a big fan of the repeated paragraphs from previous chapters in the new chapter that this author does. It would only be useful if the author didn’t update for like a month and I needed a refresher on what happened previously. As it is I consider it unnecessary padding to increase the word count of the chapter. Characters so far have filled what I consider the anime cookie cutter. We have our kind hardworking but determined ML, the cold but warm FL (whom gets described every time she shows up. We get it she’s as pretty as a goddess.) And now we have the cute bratty little sister character. The world is very interesting and vast and we aren’t overloaded with facts. They are wonderfully peppered throughout the story.

2.4852E+16,4320931521,Mickaelle09,3,"I've read all the free chapters of this book and what i got from it all , is that this book is entertaining but also very lacking. First, the pros : - The characters' interactions are good. -The MI is funny yet mysterious. - The plot is interesting and it seems to promise more than what was said in the synopsis. - The pace is nor quick nor slow . -The fl makes good use of her future knowledges. - The author's updates are rather constant and the writing is ok. Then, the cons : - The Fl was poorly designed. First, her relationship with her past-timeline husband. I know she's been hurt by him. But why is it that it isn't shown? What i mean is that the author only tells us that she wants revenge yet the fl's lack of negative feelings makes us think otherwise.To truly believe in her thirst for revenge, we must feel that fl is emotionally invested in her revenge. And this goes through seeing her actions , reactions and negative feelings when she faces the architects of her downfall. But the author has done nothing of the sort. Moreover , the author could have created a contrast between Mc's past feelings and her present ones . After all, she used to love the man so much and only recently( just before she died in the past timeline) had she learnt that he had been cheating on her the whole time with her half-sister. So just how come she passed so quickly from love to hate ? And what hate ? She basically doesn't care about him( can someone pass so quickly from love to indifference; did she even really love him?)and only wants revenge on her half sister while that ex-husband of hers is as guilty as her. Second,the FI/ Mc is not that smart.Seriously, that chapter where she played dumb before another noble lady just to slap that lady's face wasn't satisfying . She was supposed to look smart but the way she chose to deal with things just made the whole face slapping underwhelming. If anything , Mc doesn't seem that smart(which is not a problem as long as the book doesn't force us to see her as a genius). Another problem i have with this FI (and with most of romance novels' Fls) is that apart from avenging herself , she doesn't have a goal nor any other motivation in life. lf i had to resume her personality, she would be a sympathetic and mysterious girl that would have been a good side character in another character's story , if not for the fact that she possesses two blessings. - The grammar is lacking. The first chapter was perfect( at least, i didn't spot any mistake or problem). Yet in the second chapter, all this care was nowhere to be seen. And the situation was the same with the other chapters.Overall, the errors aren't so much that they can deter one from reading the book. But still, they hinder the reading experience ( some paragraphs are strangely structured or some sentences are incomprehensible ). - The pay wall. If anything, the pay wall appears too quickly for me. Recently on this platform, authors start to lock chapters under the 50 chapters bar (and often , like with this book, under the 30 chapters bar) and i think , as a reader, that it's a bummer. First , with this little number of chapters , there is a greater chance to be disappointed , because we do not know the characters and the story enough. Second,the chapters are locked so quickly yet the quality of writing displayed by this author( and some others authors on this platform) is not that good. Plus, it gives the idea that authors are only interested in readers' money and do not care about producing a quality content. All in all, this book is a big disappointment and it sadens me even more that in this review section, no one has talked about what was good and what was bad about it but rather, just stated that it was amazing. Finally, author, i pray for your improvement and hope that my review wasn't too harsh.As for others author that might read this review, please think as a reader when you write. We know you have your difficulties but we have ours too. So please make quality content and we will gladly pay for more.",942837308

I mean wth is this they left for North and it literally took 100 or more than those chapters to reach north! I agree! the story must be interesting but i feel the author is stretching too much. as for Rosie's revenge there were not even more than 10 chapters in which she took revenge, I mean i agree she would slowly take care of them but it's tooo slow! i honestly felt that story diverts it's attention to ml and this doings!🤷 bro story is based on fl so she shld be the focus not ml! If you want to focus on ml change the novel's name as Lucas game!🙄 at some point it felt like fl is like a puppy following ml. she does things on her own but not much. They keep adding new plots and there's no need for that I think...... there's no one way to the story. they keep adding new characters, plots which i feel didn't need. the story itself is truly great. the character building, story narration, background details everything is awesome. But adding more and more plots doesn't help in story development. if you add everything once it would be a mess.It would be great if you'd add plot one by one and focus more on the fl side.

The only element which doesn't have a Sacred Church is the Element of Darkness as it was destroyed, being thought to be the work of the Devil. Since then, all Dark Mages were hunted by the world and killed whenever discovered.

However, a problem i had with it was that most of the time alot of the characters know something about the secrets of the MC that the MC himself doesn't know about, at first it was okay bit it kept happening again and again that it got annoying. One more problem is that the MC seems super OP yet not OP at the same time and I'm all for it but the way its presented is annoying. He's super talented that he can absorb many crystals easily to improve and he stole alot of crystals from the academy. Moreover he has two grimoires(2 of the strongest elements),3 ancestral staffs and has high proficiency in 3 elements and he no longer has problems with his physical body due to the necklace. why the he'll does he struggle to kill the Holy Lord of wind when he was in the academy he should be able to wipe the floor with him. Moreover after Gabriel defeats izen its supposed to be something great introducing that he was a little brother of a guy on a mountain and that the world they currently live in is a desolate world takes away from the victory and makes you feel that instead of winning he failed by attracting attention of more enemies.and why does everyone know that Gabriel is karyk while he doesn't its super annoying that you just want to scream at Gabriel to figure out the obvious. To summarise 1) The others know more about the MC than the MC himself 2)The MC is not wiping the floor with others simply because of Plot instead of a good reason 3)Whenever the MC wins you figure out that the opponent beaten has a stronger opponents behind him",941543583

The writing quality it also quite terrible with whole paragraphs being added that don't need to be there at all. An obvious ploy to inflate the word count. E.g. ""Either he could stay here for eternity, or he could jump in the strange river and try to swim for an unknown amount of time. And now, the third option was available, which was to get in the boat and let the Spector take him.""This is very early on and when you read this paragraph in context you'll see that absolutely nothing is added. In a way that's almost impressive. As I said maybe it gets better later but early on (~c17) it's just a bad read.

Maybe the writing skills of the author improve, after all, it is just the first chapter.

In it's current state it's really weak. I donno if this is spoilers since it's literally the first 5 chapters but he very first plot point is that the MC gets accepted into the holy church for being the youngest mage to awaken and have a compatibility with light. The head priest of the church who is accepting him as his disciple decides not to give him a guard or a trinket to save his life or anything for that matter. We then learn there is a Head priest of the village that the MC lives in who has a son who also happened to awaken with light compatibility at the same time but he's a lil old so not so cool. The head Priest of the entire church says nope I'm not gonna accept him in the church he has to go the long way to get into the church. The problem with this is that we immediately after this fact learn how rare light users are.... so why didn't the head priest accept him? This leads to obvious hatred in the sons heart and conflict arises but you see how forced that was? How illogical that whole scenario was? It's like listening to a 5 yo lie to you using 5 yo logic but you are an adult and you can see right through it. Then there's the word padding, it starts right in the beginning. The author will blatantly rewrite but slightly reword sentences that are just reiterating the same thing over and over. Stuff you normally see in novels after they go platinum sometimes.I don't understand how this is ranked so high.... This book reminded me why I like books that have been published and have editors and an author who rereads their own work and makes multiple drafts. I hope the author goes back and rewrites this cause it seems like there's good ideas in there it just feels like whoever wrote this is in elementary school (very rookie writing mistakes).

It is overused to the point of becoming annoying. Another issue is that the world seems completely static without the MC. I.e First encounter of a boar & cultivator. They had been dead for days, but no predator in a spirit beast forest approached for a free meal. Only a mouse appeared when the MC arrived. The second encounter caused a large explosion which uprooted trees and either killed everything within 10km radius or caused it to flee out of range, when he is only 20km from a large city hosting 6 million people of which 30% are cultivators. Yet no one finds this strange and comes to investigate what happened... Not even during the 7 days in which the MC passes out beside the crater. An explosion of that magnitude would easily be heard by every person within 50km. The concept seems interesting and the writing quality is not terrible, but it feels like an insane mode test of willpower to make it past the first 20 chapters to see if things start to get better.",942837145

2.31192E+16,4321023321,Hayme_Yu,5,"First I would like to tell that I'm not good at English so please bear my review. I've been looking for something new where a main character is transported to another world then do kingdom building. This hits right off the mark, the writing quality if great I think, I don't know how to judge it but it's great since I understand it clearly without making myself awkward while reading it. The story development, hmm since it's only 12 chapters I think it is going steady and not that a fast paced. I'm looking forward when the mc is crowned as an Emperor and have a wife because an emperor must have a queen to rule right? Character design, well I like Thomas Harrier, he is a rational and intellectual person but that personality was affected by Alexander de Romanoff, a body which he is currently possessing, a playboy and loves to fool around according to the description. He is loved by his emotional beautiful silver-haired sisters and Alexander also loves them. So whenever a emotional scene appears, Thomas is conflicted with emotion because he is acting like he is not used to before thanks to the influence of Alexander affecting him in a subconscious level. Well I don't know if the prince he's alive or not. As for Thomas Harrier's intellect, I'm looking forward of him inventing modern technologies. Since he is reincarnated in a world similar to the early twentieth century, I believe it's feasible to create computers like you know skip the vacuum tubes and build transistors for computers, build modern battleships with sonars and radars, build main battle tanks akin to the 1950s or 1960s, 1950s cars, electric appliances to further his economy. Oh, didn't I tell you that Thomas Harrier has a grasp of knowledge in medicine? I won't spoil much but in the early chapters, our main character is synthesizing a streptomycin, a cure for tuberculosis to save his little sister who is afflicted with the disease. So I am looking forward for him to modernize medicine and invent medical equipment as well and win Nobel prize for medicine or physiology. This is just me giving you ideas author~sama. After reading the last chapter, I feel that our mc will transition the Empire into a constitutional monarchy because of the pressure of the people. You better listen to your people if you don't want them to revolt against you. I don't know if this is considered a smart move or not but I will say anyway, listening to your people is a best way to revitalize your country as their the driving force of your economy, without people there is no nation. The antagonist of the story is not yet fleshed out, probably because is in it's early chapters so I don't expect much from them for now but please don't forget about them. I'm looking forward for our villain here. Based on the story, our mc is the prince of Ruthenia Empire, which is based off the Russian Empire. An empire with a lot of population, lands, mineral reserves, oil reserves, golds, diamonds and has a potential to be a world superpower if not only for the predecessor of Alexander Romanoff who misgoverned the country, leading it to its economic downfall leading to workers strikes, protest, and civil unrest. The stability of updates is great, two chapters a day is enough for me This is the first novel I've read where the setting is not in Germany, so it's refreshing. Enough with the German science is the best in the world, in this story, it will be the Ruthenia's science. I hope this novel won't get cancelled just because it is similar to Russian Empire. Because we all know the ongoing conflict with Russia and Ukraine. That's all have a good day author and may the god bless you ideas to further this novel. Long live the Emperor, long live Ruthenia! .",945877215

2.31192E+16,4300246720,Hayama1,5,"I made the 5 star review because i am confused with WN review system. 1. So let's start with ""democracy"" that many people feared. No, the MC didn't just relinquished his power in the government like how the UK monarch and most constitutional monarchy did. (If some of you has some confusion with the definition constitutional monarchy, it's basically a monarchy based on the constitution. So you can write whatever the F you want in that constitution, and if the majority or every single one of the top brass of the country agrees, you can effectively become a dictator.) So in this story, what the MC wrote in the constitution is that he made himself the executive of the government, commander in chief of the armed forces, etc. Just imagine the power of any president that acts as their country executive branch with the difference of no election or terms since the MC is the king. He needs to abdicate or dead. The democracy exist only in the legislative branch. 2. Next I saw a criticism that there is only 1 royal guard. If you read it carefully, the MC got tons of guards surrounding him. Of course they would only be mentioned in 1 phrase or sentence. The one guy that is always with him is the chief of royal guards, so he had the rights to be present wherever the MC is. 3. Personal life of MC. Nothing special happened, the characters involved exist for the sake of existing, especially the love interest. 4. The reformation in labour. I have seen many people criticized this part saying it's too radical and doesn't make any sense. Yes I do agree it's very radical considering the era of the story, however it's necessary to be done to appease the hungry and angry citizens. The thing that is a pity would be that there is not much explanation on the consequences of such radical reform. The author just glossed over it and make it seems like there is no fight from the capitalists. Similar thing happened when the MC reformed the regional government, changing it from viceroyalties to electoral positions like we know in most countries. 5. How the MC run the government. The main thing of how the MC do his job is that he would do anything to ensure the safety of his empire, family, and citizens. He didn't really care about other countries and their citizens. It can be seen with the war against yamato arc or him sending 2 fighter jets with air to ground missiles to destroy stolen military vehicles in a village. 6. Finally it would be grammar and writing in general. I don't have much to say in this since I don't have much knowledge in writing. So I have no complain on grammar. However on the writing side, I am confused with the title of the MC. In some part he was mentioned as ""Emperor"" and in some other parts it was ""Tsar"". Please make it consistent. Final score: 6.5-7.5/10",945878196

This series is my second favorite series and you can read each book separately (which I did not know when I started or I would have prolly read the second book first lol) and still know what is going on and that fascinates me to no end because every series i have read you have to read them in order and that is NOT the case here!!!

BUT, I had to drop this novel in the beginning of chapter 94 because RACISM is not okay!!!!!🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️❌💯 And if that racist remark by the author was not deliberate and was so-called “casual” and “not intentionally racist”, then that’s even worse and points to a bigger problem.💯 There is nothing casual about racism! and I was greatly disappointed to see such unnecessary wording!!

I am the type of person that can keep readying if there is really bad grammar, and even if there are allot of plot holes. But i cant stand when Authors give there MC's an op background and nerf them just to make the conflicts they have more interesting. In this case i hate the fact that The author says that the MC has an IQ of 260. And before he reincarnated he was 26 years old. So he should be really smart right? he shouldn't act like a child right? he should think things through before acting right? nope! he does none of that. He gets upset when his mom treats him like a kid, when he is one in his new world. You would think he would realize that his mom does not know he has the mind of a 26 year old( or should have, since there's times he acts like a kid) He adopts a kid and his sister who is sick on the spot for no reason at all and makes them his lil bro and big sis. He treats every one like there his best friend and they have known each other for years. Even though there is people that want him dead, and he knows that because he was poisoned by those people, so you would think he would be cautions of new people right? But hes not. Chapters also drag on and on, The author did mention that this novel was going to be like 2000 chapters i don't know why. Now i could understand if he was actually slowly building up the technology. So of course it would make sense to have allot of chapters. But most of the chapters are basically filler, because theirs like 10 chapters of his knights training. Nothing to do with building his city up, just lots of chapters of them doing training drills. Like the author could not give us a quick synopsis of what there training was? I know there are people that like it, and if the MC wasn't so dumb, when he should be crazy smart. Even with all the chapters that feel like filler, even with the bad grammar. I would probobly really enjoy this, But the more i read i keep thinking ""he's so F**king stupid, why is he so F**king stupid"". And I am just not enjoying reading it.

Character developments good so far too, slow in a good way, where we are told an appropriate amount of information about a character for how long the MC has known them (there's no ""you saved my life so here's my entire life history and also my unending loyalty). Not to say the MC doesn't quickly form relationships(in a way that fits his character/personality), but so far everything has been progressing naturally. The only criticisms I have are not knowing much about the MC's history, but I'm only on chp 14 so it could still be coming, or it might be more of a gradual reveal, either way I'd like to know just a bit more early on. Also, the world is large, and location names are kinda hard to keep track of. If anyone is thrown by other reviews complaining about the sex, know it isn't really described explicitly(so far I've only seen 1 short instance describing the sex, 95% of the time its ""they kissed and went to the bedroom"", end paragraph, then ""After an enjoyable night MC woke up"" and its right back to the story). Also wouldn't describe it as ""harem"", he's not collecting girls for his adventuring party or anything, it's more like he's a warm, passionate guy(see fire affinity), and having casual sex in a no-risk virtual world fits his and others characters.",962591830

There was one person who complained about him being a little sheep and beta male since he easily accepted his master as his master when he had no idea who he was. You do realize he is the only disciple on the peak and would get all the resources right? This is said multiple of times.

The romance slowly buds even though it started with a *spoiler* arranged political marriage. Both knew each other and were on the stage of 'no dislike' and grew to the stage of like. Both of them are actually quite naive in love and their growing mutual like is quite innocent. It may seem cheesy but I thought it was sweet. That said, the novel is still mainly a Xianxia.

2.00677E+16,4300013253,TribeOfOne,2,"This review is after reading the first 50 chapters during the trial period. All I can say is - this novel is extremely boring. First off, let me state that I'm not a big fan of Sign In novels. I've always found them to be a really boring type of system, copied from some of the worst free-to-play games. However, I went into this novel with an open mind, willing to give it a chance. The main problem with this novel isn't the Sign In system, but just that it's so incredibly boring. It's written more like a documentary about the life of an immortal, rather than a story of the events around the hero. The author has no sense of how to create tension or suspense in any scene. The MC is an almost emotionless doll that never reacts to anything around him, he's always lost in his own world. Even on the rare occasions that he gets into a fight, he has an utterly deadpan personality, and it feels like I'm seeing the author write about a walking piece of tofu rather than a human being. The fight scenes aren't completely worthless, as the MC uses a silly fighting style similar to One Punch Man, where he kills everything with a single punch, but even that just feels boring because there's no strategy to the fights. The fights get over before they've even begun, and most of the time the MC doesn't even know why the fight happened in the first place, because he's such a boring blob of tofu that he doesn't care to find out. Another serious problem with this novel is how it tries to badly ramp up the drama through scenes where the MC does an ""amazing"" task in front of other disciples of his sect. The problem is that the author has no idea what's actually impressive to look at through the eyes of a reader. For example, he spends several chapters talking about how ""the MC dared to take one more step"" in order to obtain treasures or walk on a lake, all while a crowd of background characters keeps shouting out how absolutely amazing it is that the MC can keep taking that step. It feels very artificial and forced, to the point that I want to puke just thinking about it. On the positive side, because the MC is so utterly bland, some of the side characters appear more relatable. There's a female character, a senior sister, who's actually wiling to listen to the MC's advice and words, and there's a senior brother who takes him seriously and accepts him as a rival on the path of cultivation. The problem is just that they're still incredibly shallow, up to the point I've seen. Rather than have independent personalities of their own, they feel like they were specially constructed characters created just to make the MC look better. The story tries to show us that even for a genius MC, it still takes hundreds of years to walk down the path of immortal cuktivation. While that's a nice mindset to have, the problem is when there's nothing at all happening during all those hundreds of years. TL DR : It's a boring story about an unexpressive MC doing nothing but cultivating for hundreds of years.",1023204840

2.00677E+16,121294810,LostEra,4,"after having read all the normal chapters, and most of the epilogue, I must say this is one of the most satisfying novels I have read on the platform so far. And the main reason for that is that it is well written. The story is well planned out and everything that happens in the story happens for a reason, and at the end it all comes together. The story is about a guy with a sign in system who becomes the only disciple of the 9th peak of the Kunlun sect. The sign in system allows him to get high quality resources appropriate for his level if he signs in at a place with dao accumilation. Although his body is not very suited for cultivation his mindset is, and coupled with the sign in resources he cultivates faster than anyone else (and despite this he needs several 100 years to become an immortal). He keeps his true cultivation hidden from everyone and avoids conflict as much as possible but when he needs to fight he is very overpowered. Not all people will like the mc though, I think some would find him boring, but having said that just know that even the boring personality is part of the plot. But I found the boring, always cultivating, personality was not really a problem bc it was also part of a good solution to something that I find a bit strange with most xianxia novels, when you think a bit deeper about the sort of life an immortal cultivator has than a lot of things should happen on a far wider timescale than in most novels. A cultivator needs a lot of time to cultivate and the amount of times they go out can be measured in years, maybe even decades but most mc's rush towards the higher cultivation levels in a couple of years and rarely do they take a long cultivation break that lasts years. And the stupid thing is that even though the mc has a system there fewer moments that the mc had plot armor or that something illogical happened than with the mc's who always get into a fight wvery city they visit. Now this mc takes it a bit to the extreme with long cultivation sessions, but that cultivation takes time is not overlooked. And in the same line of thinking the relationship he builds up with the love interest, builds up over years. They meet after he has been in the sect for a couple of years, they get betrothed after 150 years, marries after 600 years, etc. It was very satisfying to see an author implement some of the things I thought about when I read other novels. The only minor negative is that the story could have had a bit more action if the mc was forced to participate a bit more in going outside the sect, that could have added a couple 100 chapters. But since the reasoning behind this choice is explained and is part of the plot I don't mind it at all (not sure if such an mc, even with a similar good reason, would work in other stories. I think the author and translator did a good job of keeping the story interesting but I can understand not everyone thinks the same)",1023205401

Personally, I enjoy reading about a hidden expert watching the world slowly change around them and only intervening every once in a while.

2.00677E+16,4306864232,TheUnsuspicious,4,"ive read to chap 154 this is a sign in system story. meaning that the MC will focus more on cultivating that takes like decades before coming out to gain some insight before going into retreat again. action do exist but is it's very little at the beginning. although at the later time, it does increases but it is still quite minimal. MC is told to have great temperament. meaning that he wont panic or show great emotion when facing any situation. and yes, thats what how he acts at the story. he wont help anyone if it endangers himself or risky. he is not a good person nor a bad person. he is a lawful neutral person. only when it involved his master would he begin to show such emotion. characters are great and theres a lot of untap potential for future plots. world background are not explained unless needed. the romance is great though. this is still a xianxia novel but the romance is quite pure, unlike the usual xianxia where they meet, face some danger together, fall in love, and then become couple. they actually *spoiler* get engage before falling in love. and right now they dont like each other, but have a favourable impression towarss each other. and because it is such a pure interaction where they slowly get close together. i can only honestly say that you should read this for the romance. the other aspects is fine and depending on preference, it can be good or bad. so before you start reading, please know that : 1. MC is a lawful neutral and wont help unless he have a good reason 2. theres not much action as expected from a sign in system genre 3. romance is a slow growing type",1023205717

At least when reading/watching a slice of life every now and then I could go ""Whoa that supermarket arc was wild"" but this on the other hand is entirely flat and unstimulating and the fact that I can quite literally predict what's going to happen next 100% of the time is a real ""I'm not mad, just disappointed"" moment. 0.75/5.",1023205018

The villain are brain dead they have many ways to make mc suffer and destroy him but they chose the most idiotic way which is to fight him one by one head on I feel like the villain can kipnap his aunt and threaten him that would make it more interesting,1023205271

1.32824E+16,4304936675,BlissfulDeath,5,"I think this story deserves an honest, detailed review so I will give it one. First, let's get two things out of the way. One: the mc tends to work on seducing girls he chooses and ""rapes"" those that try to kill him. Two: The author didn't do himself justice by saying ""you can expect a lot of smut, comedy, and face-smacking"" because while it is true, there is so much more. Writing Quality: Excellent. If you've navigated the sea of horrifying grammar most webnovel authors have to offer, you will be pleasantly surprised to see here someone who actually knows how to use the English language to produce an enjoyable reading experience. Stability of Updates: It speaks for itself really. I don't think you will find many authors out there doing better than this. At least one chapter a day, and you might get surprised with more. Story Development: The beginning was a bit rushed. And in my opinion, it seems that rush was more of a method for the author to show what he was capable of in terms of writing to pull in the readers. I might be getting ahead of myself by saying that, but the steady pace past the sixth chapter seems to indicate that. Character Design: Let's face it. When you sign up for this kind of novels, you don't expect much in those areas. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that all the principal characters are well fleshed out and have defining traits (the first girl, in particular, proves to be the most interesting in the latest chapters. But again, that's my opinion). World Background: And that's one of my favorites. The author seamlessly mixed German and Chinese culture (with some personal tweaks) to build his fantasy world. There is no large info dump, and things are revealed in a gradual process, when necessary. The interaction with the system is hilarious, but not the only source of comedy (it's the most entertaining in my opinion though). The main girls (those identified so far) don't just fall into his hands like puppets for no reasons. There are many surprises and political intrigues as the story develops. All in all, this is an entertaining read, and I shall keep following it.",1035217763
1.32824E+16,4304799353,AndellOfficial,5,"Reading the title and then reading this may cause some confusion but this is one of the best written work that I have read on this site. The character development in this novel is well above the average that can typically be found in originals, and even many other professional works. As of now the updates are consistent and you can very easily feel the care that the author puts into the work and the devotion with their fans by the regular contact that can be on the discord channel trying to improve the story at all possible points. The characters begin with interesting interactions and they are constantly built up to give more of a personal feel where it seems like you or someone you know could be in that position and have conversations with them that feel real. The MC is a bit of a scoundrel in the view of society but I love characters like him in novels and can't really find any objectionable points (but I'm a huge S so that alone might discount my POV). The women are interesting and when you think about the magic that they are under their actions are all fairly believable without huge jumps in logic that you can find in other works like where the MC r.a.p.e.s a female lead and for no reason she ends up with Stockholm Syndrome by the time they finish. The world building has only just begun but the map of the world and a general understanding of etiquite and culture be seen under construction. I have no doubt that if the autor contiues with the current work for the rest of 2019 then this will turn into an absolute masterpiece among any group of webnovels. (First review I've ever written so I'm not sure how good it is or if my point gets across well, but basically, MUST READ is the only way to describe this novel)",1023205251

1.32824E+16,765148867,TalenX,4,"So this is the sort of story that relatively easy to dismiss at first glance. It's a sort of wish fulfillment story with lots of the trappings of what you would expect from the genre. In short it's smut, and it's not terribly shy about admitting it. However it's also well written, with more than just that basic bare bones plot you might expect. The MC has some issues, but a lot of the characters are well thought out and have a place in the world where you'll feel they 'fit'. At this point the heroine's come in two distinct flavors, with a name and without. The heroines with a name have a place in the story and in general you can expect them to have some impact on both the story and the MC. The nameless ones are generally cannon fodder who attack the MC and then revenge is apparently a dish best served with mind altering pheromones. At the point of this review the story is still growing but has bits of sociopolitical intrigue and while it hasn't shown up as more than window dressing, it shows that the author has invested in the story to some degree and provides hints of things to come. Being honest there are parts where the story is a little rushed and events would have been more impactful if they had been drawn out a little more, but it's far and away better than a majority of the quick fiction stories you'll find excluding genre, and far and away better than most you'll find in the genre.",1023205762

I see no difference between Ji Ning, Qin Yu, Xu Jingming, etc are all literally the same character. But thats fine, people who are reading IET for the first time will get something that isnt straight garbage but I have a big problem with this particular novel. I can *feel* the nationalism when I read this. IET wasnt making it subtle whatsoever here. China #1 can be felt throughout my first 100 or so chapters, lemme explain. So the entire world is given VR technology and when they go online they can practice martial arts. After a while a ranking ranking is made with the strongest at the top and guess which nationality 2 of the top 3 are? Thats right folks, its granddaddy China with the other from Botswana. It just seems like China is naturally more talented than every other country by a wide margin. Lets not even get into the comments from the live streaming in VR, its constantly about oh man, these expert martial artists from [other country] are strong, but China is still better. I think the funniest example is in chapter 148 when the strongest from Korea is made out to be an arrogant mf who is going around challenging the top 3 just to get more views on his live stream. I feel like IET's recent novels have lost the magic from Desolate Era, Swallowed Star, COILING DRAGON, Stellar Transformation, etc and part of that is the nationalism here, while in the other recent novels its been a lot more logical. In his earlier works the MC got super lucky at the start and then had to muddle through the entire universe just to be the best and in recent time the MCs dont get lucky, they were just naturally talented and got some benefits here and there that make sense. My problem is that making sense doesnt carry the same *brilliance* of a moment like in Desolate Era where Ji Ning gets the inheritance and starts his journey or when Lou Feng died fighting the Gold Dragon.",1023205519

For example, everything so far and implied for the future by the title is going to be combat tournament arcs. No offense but tournament arcs are usually the worst part of any light novel. Authors seem to stick to the formula and i cannot imagine why an author like IET would limit themselves to a story like that, especially when they describe thw characters using weapons in ways that the weapons are not used. The best example is the Halberd scene where IET describes the warrior stabbing with the point and swinging with the bladed end. This is not how Halberds are used. Its like saying someone shooting a handgun is supposed to hold it sideways like a gangster its inproper and inaccurate. Halberds are held with two hands and the staff end is used to parry and prod until an opening is made where the combatant can bring the axe/hammer end down. Put it quite simply the book doesn’t seem all that intresting 42 chapters in so im dropping This is a 2 and a 1/2 star book but I have to give two 5 stars for update stability and translation quality so tale the score as you will.",1023204840

Plus there are many factors that are included also. The character development is unique in a sense but is refined, I just hope that the MC doesn't date a gold digger in the future. The updates are constant, in which it is updating almost every day. The background of the world is the same as our real world with some real-life figures in the beautiful game. The character design is also really simple, I just hope that he can do stuff like recaps of what character looks like and their current stats. Overall the story is pretty good, although I don't want him to play with the DR Congo national team. Unless they get a huge boost in the squad which is probably going to happen.

He's trying to save the world on his own terms. With that out of the way, it is very readable. MC is definitely OP since he has obtained multiple rewards that although separately are good, combined in the same person make him progress very quickly. However, this is somewhat balanced with the fact that demons are way stronger than humans. As a result, he keeps having to fight enemies quite above his level. Anyways, I suggest you don't let comments about racism/nationalism dissuade you, it's not as bad as some are making out to be.",1133571245

(2)--Mc is extremely-extremely Partriotic to the point he thinks of his family and China together while he doesn't care if other countries get destroyed or not.And i think they nuke japan when it gets invaded by demons... of course the use a different name like unity country or harmony country something.He even gives a speech of how great his country is which makes you want to vomit🤮 (3)--Claims that he doesn't like to hide his power but is extremely contradictory as his rank is basically lower than almost everyone and waits till situation gets out of hand.His personality is extremely arrogant.

Especially the cultivation technique, the buddha one specifically, which I find really intersting. If this novel was more focused on this aspect, like how he adapts to life as a different person and showing his interactions as a new person in a different sect, it would been one of the best novels I've read. This kind plotline is what I love most in novels, which is why I like LoM and AWE. So this novel had a lot of potential. However, it didn't really delve much deeper into this and instead focused on the cliche sect competition and what not. So it was pretty disappointing. Yet even so, it is still very well written and there is a lot of logic and rationality behind the MC's actions and the world itself. Furthermore, the writing is quite sharp in a very nonchalant and restrained way and many times feel pretty sarcastic or satirical.

Writing Quality is a bit disappointing. ""Show, don't tell"" is a cornerstone of writing. There are lots of explanations for everything with info dumps, instead of a slow but steady discovery. Various descriptions are awkward many times as well. In addition, there are a number of typos. I honestly just expect more from a premium novel. Author updates regularly, which is great. Story development feels pretty basic. Nothing groundbreaking or new. There's a system. Someone has transmigrated. Theres a tournament arc. Etc. It doesn't pull me in because I feel like I've seen it all before. For a world that is being invaded, it doesn't feel like it at all. Everyone seems too casual about it all. Normal people just living their lives casually when the world is falling apart around them. We had a global pandemic where people were dying from covid, and things changed everywhere. I can't imagine monsters invading, and people just acting like martial arts are just ""sports"" anymore. You give little to no impression about how society has changed from this. Character design is a little boring. I wish that there was a little more character development. Everyone other than the MC feels a bit two dimensional. Even the MC sometimes feels a bit boring. I don't know how you plan to bring character growth to the MC either since he was already an adult, and he is doing the same thing he was doing in his previous life. There needs to be personal growth for the characters, otherwise you result in a Xianxia novel where everyone is rigid and unreasonable.

It seemed like the author listened to readers comments a bit too much and went back and rewrote chapters which changed future paths he had already visualized. While it's good to learn from mistakes and try to make fans happy, don't ever let them change your novel midway through. This will change the way the author writes the rest of the novel even if it's subconsciously, which in this case seemed to wilt his enthusiasm for this one, which ended up causing it to get dropped suddenly. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy White Online, but my personal opinion and a few of my buddies who've read both agree that Martial Arts Master was overall a better read and had even greater potential if it wasn't dropped.

All I can say is, this was an awesome read that’s pretty set apart from other typical transmigration novels, so I’m giving it two thumbs up and a holler. What I really liked was the fact that both the FL and ML aren’t made to be super OP and ridiculously invincible. They have their own flaws that just makes them more realistic and relatable, which endears them more to me. For example, the FL was born with such a weak physique (because she’s always surrounded by ghosts and spirits) that she tends to faint all the time. I also like how she is upfront with how she’s not an altruistic angel - she helps the wandering souls pass on mainly because it’s the only way for her to stay alive. None of that Mary Sue crap that makes me cringe. There’s also plenty of humour, thanks to her hilarious interaction with her family members, as well as some side characters that adds flavour to the story. Add on tons of face-slapping action and you’ve got a pretty damn satisfying read. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",1049767820

1.90998E+16,4300968014,Young_Mistress,5,MC is very talented and beautiful. ML is the crown prince. It’s not cliche at all despite that since the emperor actually dotes on the crown prince and most women dislike the crown prince because he’s crippled. There is no palace intrigue which is really nice. And MC would never let herself be disadvantaged and aggrieved. Overall it hit all the right spot. A perfect historical romance for me.,1049767738

1.90998E+16,4301079682,phoenix_8888,4,"Overall the story is not bad, it has a FL that seems to be sensible, some foolish side characters and at this point I am not sure if the male character with the ""unknown"" identity is the male lead. However, his actions so far seem to be that of a decent character. Considering that this story has over 1000 chapters, my guess is that this will cover over 3 years of twice daily 4 SS chapters. I cannot guarantee that the story will remain in my library for long but I will read it for now as I'm not bored as yet. One thing for sure is that the story is slow, at this point there has been approx. 3 days covered and they are not even close to reaching the main destination. I also get annoyed at their repetitve desciption of the FL being extremely weak.

I'm not sure if the author intended it this way, but I hope the system gives MC some options, such as in the skill tree and shop.

2.39933E+16,4319532642,Kurai_Takahashi,4,"It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, so I won't lie and say it's the best novel on this site. Give it a read, if you aren't interested in the first ten chapters then you probably won't fully immerse. However, I must say it was worthwhile writing this, so I'm sure it's going to be worthwhile for some of you to read this as well. Review: World Background: As of now not much about the world has been explored as it is still very early into the plot. Though I have plans of creating a massive world with its own history and politics, we will have to wait and see if I have the ability to deliver. Writing Quality: Though I speak English often, I am not a native speaker. That's to say, my writing is readable, but not impeccable. However, I don't believe that it takes much from the quality of the story, but you will notice a few errors here and there. Story Development: The pacing is rather on the slow side, though it is to be expected with the type of story I am trying to create. As of now, not much has happened in the plot, but it is indeed beginning to thicken, Character Design: I try my best to give my characters depth, and though it does not show now. I have already set the foundations for future character growth and hence dimension. Overall an average story told by an average author. Though you would do well not to assume you have any clue whatsoever where my novel is heading. The media I consume is vastly different from that on this site, and my end game will go in a different direction from most third-rate work that is devoured here. Happy reading.",1049767684
2.39933E+16,4316171063,daoist_reborn,4,"TLDR: AMAZING, must read. Hope it stays this good. As mentioned previously by a different reviewer; a plant MC and Kingdom building is definitely a huge win. Not to mention the uniqueness of the story, even if not all that different from other system novels, makes it a great read. Although there are only 22 chapters, at the time of this review, and not enough time has passed for us to learn about the world background or new chapter speed, this is definitely going to become one of my favorite novels. The only cons of the story, so far, would have to be the occasional grammar mishap or the brain f**k when the author mixes a few words up. 10/10",1049767738

2.39933E+16,4322646031,Lol1san,3,"This novel can be summarized in one word: 'boring'. People might think that being a leafling, constantly evolving and slowly getting stronger is fun. Even I thought so at first and I admired the idea and the way the author wrote it, but as it progressed I realized that I didn't enjoy what I was reading at all. To me, this novel is just a copy of slime anime, the reincarnated slime Rimuru, except that Mc goes around training soldiers and playing sergeant. The difference is that he always trains leaflings with low IQ and shares the advantages and knowledge of his system with them. Other than that, it is a similar kingdom building novel. I don't know why it was fun for some people to see him training his little army down to the smallest detail, but for me it was not worth reading. In the same way, it is pointless to try to make another leafling as strong as him in every evolution. These are creatures at the bottom of the power ladder of the world background. You might think that the only advantage of training them would be long term loyalty but that is a big NO. As a former soldier or agent, Mc is too soft on them. In one chapter a leafling was kicking him in the face and he was just indifferent. At least if you are building your own army you have to make them fear and respect for you. It doesn't have to be all of them always like ""Yes, Sir!"" to you but what's the point if you don't want to keep them under your power and make them follow your orders? To me it was a boring MC. It's too early to talk about world building as the pace of the story is slow. But he and his 'cheat' are completely pointless. If at the end of the story a leafling who starts from the same level as him - from the bottom - will be at the same power level as him and be disrespectful to him, why should I read this sergeant role play novel ?",1111546168

2.39933E+16,4319532642,Kurai_Takahashi,4,"Okay, I've written about 145 chapters as of writing this, and it's time I update my initial review. Firstly Writing Quality: Once again, I'm not native, but I feel I've done a decent job. The grammar isn't superb, but its readable, to the point where people can still enjoy reading. Stability of Updates: Ooof, well my update stability has been horrible for the past few weeks due to other projects. But I'm back on track. Hopefully you guys see my new novel come up on your recommends. Story Development: I've taken a slow pace approach at writing, and its paying off. There's a sense of gratification in the later chapters, seeing all everything coming together. I'm also proud of the plotlines I've implemented. If you follow along, you can see there is an overarching plot, and small scale plots. Things become very exciting past chapter 120. Character Design: Suprisingly, I'm more impressed with the side character then the main character. Not to say that the main character is bad, he's just somewhat inconsistent at times, as I sometimes forget what his background used to be. But all his mishaps can be explained, though to be honest, it mostly because I'm still an amateur. As for mt favourite character? Conspiracist leafling. World Background: 6/5 I'm very proud of the world I've built. Quite unique, type of stuff you can't read anywhere else. The only race you will know of are the humans, and maybe Fae, apart from that, you're in for a treat.",1111546022

I also quite enjoy the fact that both perspectives are given. To see events from all parties is very rich in its presentation! A critique point: The only time I n my reading that I found to pull me from the immersion was the past and present chapters. Aside from that, it was a complete treat!",1111546715

When I say grammar is smooth, well no errors or perhaps its my eyes lol. use of word is nice and the humour in it lol. the flow of each scenes was nicely related and it wasn't overdone.

Why?First, Because I really wanted to save every word from every chapter that enthu wrote in my mind. From other stories I really love Jun and it's his story so i can't help but read line and line very thoroughly. Second, the sentence formation. The way author put words or we can say that the depth of the words make great impact on the readers mind. It is a mature (understanding level) writing but at the same time it is very easy to understand what author wants to tell us from the stories. We get a lesson from every story, that lesson always teach us something that can be helpful in our life not at that moment but somewhere in future. In enthu's stories, at least I, imagine myself in every character, which help me to understand that character and also why it is that way only. It always helps me to improve my understanding level also my judgements. I would like to appeal every reader to read enthu's stories, that will make your vision widen for sure.

Honestly even the people are so stupid. they can't even connect the dots when they have the same last name, so much for so many coincidence! if MC really loved and trusted his wife, then he'd confess the truth soon after he got permission to make debut to the world... but no, the author dragged it out to the point of killing readers with boredoms, fury, and frustration...🙂🙂",1111545909

1.79329E+16,4303273970,TheHermitKing,3,"Stopped reading at chapter 63 (almost all of the free chapters) and my verdict is that this story is.....annoying. Annoying in that the author is constantly teasing readers by not revealing the ML's status to everyone this whole time. The reason it's annoying is because a person that is as stupidly stubborn towards their own family as the FML exists. And she has a husband who has the power to fix all the problems, but loves her so much that he wants her to show everyone what she is made of. So the problem is that the characters are realistic, and that they've just been running around this problem for so long now, all so that the author can write in face-slapping events. IMO, since he wants her to show how great she is to everyone, it could still be easily solved by publicizing his status, and then giving her free reign over her own companies to spread her wings. Other than that, the story starts off a bit awkwardly in that it doesn't talk about his coming-up story, and although not perfect, there are very few grammatical errors, so it isn't hard to read. The world is a mix of modern day and fantasy, with mentions of modern companies and whatnot",1111545213

1.90998E+16,4311051200,ChimkinNuggie,4,"This book is a breath of fresh air. This is due to the fact that the FL has a family behind her who genuinely loves her. It's not every person whose supposed to love her vs her and the ML, which is a wonderful change. The start is a bit confusing because it has a bit of a hard time separating the past and the present. And example of this is during the part where it says that the ML destroyed the Su family as repayment for a past good deed she had done for him, but right before that it said she was in the hospital dying and the Su family had basically moved her and refused to help her. Thus Thame starting timeline is a little wonky. Also, at one point they make it almost second like the story you reading a a novel that she transmigrated to( which isn't the case). Lastly, the author establishes that the evil older sister is 5 years older that the FL, but they are somehow in the same grade at the same school? That doesn't logically make sense especially considering the fact that the FL is bad at her studies. Those are my complaints, but the story is really fun and I like the characters. the FL is cute, the ML is a good representation of a prideful person who suddenly becomes disabled so he's cold and emotionally distraught. Her family (the ones who care about her) are wonderful and supportive. And the side characters are hysterical. So 8 out of 10 I'm loving this story and can't wait to read more.",1111546354

2.01046E+16,4300765917,AimanFaroqq,4,"this is my thought on this novel after reading up to 48 chapters i will be dead honest, this is a novel that i must say.. a hidden gem with extremely big potential to grow with good marketings. It has nice story, good and normal pace plot development, and good character development. I prefer you to put the power level in this world as we still don't know how does one determine their strength. I wish you will have these in the future but anyway its a good novel for me to spend my money on but at the same time, this novel have something that might make veteran readers burst into anger. First of all, although i said the character development is good, the way you write it out can piss people off. I almost threw my phone out of anger reading the first 40 chapter. Yes you want to make MC a naive dumb boy but smart i can accept that, but you exaggerate it. You make him look like a beta japanese male weeb in japan. I suggest you need to fastened his maturity progression in the next 10 chapters or veteran readers will immediately drop this novel. Also about Aleshia, just like I said, u exaggerate it. You make her way too paranoid and this will leave reader a bad taste in their mouth regarding her. Its nice to see a proper relationship progression over his maids one by one as to make the story longer and interesting but dont make it too out of line that it disrespect MC dignity as a noble. Also he is not giving any punishment at all. I would like to see all his maids total obedience to him Also for future readers.. i suggest you all to fast read chapter 1 to 40 as to avoid you leaving this novel.Trust me you will be eager to swipe your card past those chapters. Also trust me as long author not losing few screws in the head for future development, this novel will be a good workout for your slumbering dragon. I will give 4* at the moment because of the updates, character development and world background. I will give 5* after this have more chapters, clarification on power level and a better, brave and mature MC with his maids not being so paranoid. Best of luck. I have insulted and scolded a lot of authors in webnovel considering how they are so terrible making improvement in their novels. I have high expectation on this.

2.01046E+16,4310008570,Krisavq,3,"Tbh, I've only read until chapter 22 because the MC is bad and waiting for character development for 39 chapters isn't worth the read. Author could've made the character development in a much shorter time frame than having to wait almost 40 chaps, I GUARANTEE that most of your readers have dropped the story because of how long the character development is. The writing quality is amazing since you can really understand the story well and the Grammer mistakes are next to none. The story can be slow at some points but it fleshes out the side characters well. All in all the story is great I love it but the MC is really off putting and some readers can't handle that, including me. If you can handle waiting for a character development then try this story out, it's good. If you can't then don't waste your time reading this.",1111551120

The story is good, after chapter 40 it gets very interesting, if you wait until then, you'll like it. Writing Quality: 5.0 (I don't complain about this, I didn't find any errors) Update stability: 5.0 (I don't follow since the beginning, but since I started every day new chapters have been posted) Story development: 5.0 (the story is great, it has everything to last a hundred chapters, but the MC development is depressing and frustrating because it takes so long) Character designs: 1.0 (only 4 things are quoted from the characters: whether he's handsome or not, apparent age, hair color and whether he's fat or thin, it's kind of hard to imagine the characters with these descriptions where they don't even talk about details , not even for the main characters) World Background: 2.0 (difficult to assess, almost nothing has been presented yet) PS; But the next arc has a lot of potential, I confess that I'm a little excited about it, so I can increase my score more, remembering that the soap opera is at the beginning, there's a lot to happen, I'm not offending this comment, but I give my honest opinions about romance.",1111554387

The title pretty much says it all when it comes to maids, cause well, if they weren't in the story, this novel would have such a title. With many things (wacky things at most) happening as you read, it will take time to decipher what exactly the end goal is at the eventual end, although it's still a long road for that. Despite of this, the author does a good job at grabbing the reader's attention. The early chapters have something going on at most. Only criticism I have would be the setting, there's not much going on so hopefully that will be the case in the future.

2.16371E+16,4300327973,MotivatedSloth,5,"As the author of this novel, if I won't give it five stars, who else would? In a sense, this is a run-of-the-mill cultivation novel with a small, original twist to it. Or rather, to every aspect that might seem simple on the surface, when you will first read about it. Arrogant young master? He will act his age and status rather than throwing everything he has on the Main Character just because. If someone has high social standing, they need to know how to act the part. Female lead being a jade beauty? Yeah, but she won't start as op throwaway that MC can use to grow, but an actual partner with her own problems and a different view on the world than our dear Arthur has. OP main character oblivious to his strength? Yeah, what would a cultivation novel be without a strong lead? But being strong in a cultivation world... is a relative thing. Do you remember the saying, a frog in the well only seeing a small fragment of the sky? With the MC transmigration from an earth-like world, he won't know the basic common sense of the world. And while some of his novel-sourced knowledge will apply, some will not. Constant reset with each rank? Yeah, the ceiling for the absolute power is even higher than you can imagine (unless you read my first big novel that is *wink wink*), but it comes with its own rules and flow. TL:DR - This is a novel that's simple on the surface, but deep underneath it. The MC has its own view on the world, created by the hardships he went through in his original life, and those won't randomly disappear once he starts his new life. Yes, there will be sm*t. It wouldn't be my novel if there wouldn't be. Yes, there will be romance. I consider it an integral part of every story. Yes, there will be moments when MC will be unreasonable, will act stupid, won't be the strongest in the room, won't know anything... But how can he grow if he won't face challenges? Q/A: Q:H*rem? A: No, no and no. I'm not saying MC will only ever see a single girl, but he won't live in polyamorous relationship. Ever. Period. Q: Update rate? A: Between 1 and 5 chapters a day. I will try my best to do at least 2 a day, 3 on a good day, 4 if I'm motivated and 5 if I'm trying to prove something to myself. Q: Bonus release for power stones/golden tickets? A: I might consider it, but I won't promise anything. I have a bad history with racking up chapter debt to the readers so I would rather be cautious about it and have consistent, high update rate Q: Any perks for loyal readers? A: If I take notice on you, we might think about it. Q: Does author replies to the comments? A: Yes I do and no I don't. If a comment goes in depth about the chapter, asks valid questions, points out foreshadowing or shows readers own idea of the story, I will likely reply to them. It's a pleasure to read them and I won't leave them alone. But a comments of the ""thanks for the chapter"" ""first"" ""your moma"", while appreciated, won't get much of my attention. Q: What is the answer to universe? A: 44, or so the joke and google says Q: Why do you have smol pepe? A: Your momma cried out something else last night Q: Do reviews get deleted? A: If they are valid, point out problems with the story, tells your opinion, shows the readers what you like and what you dislike, then I do not touch them. But if they are 1-2-3 stars with emojis or pure insults in them, my finger won't hesitate before pressing that delete button. Q: Are you going to go premium with this novel? A: Yeah, I am. As much as some of you may hate it, in order to write as much as I do (and this isn't my only novel, mind that) I need to somehow provide for myself. Times, when my parents did that for me, are over. Q: Why 1 star your own novel? A: It's my personal protest against WN biased and useless rating system.",1111546326

Characters are memorable, and continue to build depth. The strongest part of this novel, the plot IMO, is riveting and engaging thru and thru. I really cannot wait to read this thru to the end. Definitely a gem among rocks. I HIGHLY recommend giving this a shot.",1111546347
2.16371E+16,4316052271,BlackFlamer,4,"Detailed review without spoilers. A few things here will come from the first 5 chaps so it's mostly spoiler-free. TLDR: This novel is immersive and stands out from the rest of the system novels with the usual tropes and clichés. Characters act their age and personality and there is always character development going around. If you want to read something that will make you want to read more, read this. Writing quality: Sloth probably has one of the best written story from a grammatical point of view. However, some of the things felt a little too explained. As much as I like the detailed descriptions, many people will skim it. But since I am writing an honest review, that's a 4/5 for me. Story development: the pace is quite well and you'll feel like going on to the next chapter just to know what will happen next. One of the best things is that the young master trope is not here. In simpler and spoiler-free terms, a young master acts his status and title here. Another 4/5. Character design: Now that deserves a five. Be it the MC or Mia or any other character, they are created really well. And if you don't think Mia is adorable, I will personally come and hunt you with a knife. Updating stability: Another five out of five. As mentioned in sloth's review, his updating stability depends on his mood but 2 chapters are almost guaranteed. No problems here World Background: Personally, there are many things left to be discovered but I think that the world-building is rather slow. It takes quite some time for things to build up but from the point of a reader, it's a 3.5/5 from me. Just keep on pumping chapters sloth. Your dear reader",1111545785

Cons: - A beta MC that cant really stand for himself unless he's feeling right for doing it. Insecure but powerful. - Plot is...slow. So slow. Too slow. - A lot of bs bout how to feel for pple but also beating pple just as fine. - Hard to empatize with MC (imho). To sum up: cant keep it up. Too much BS.

Young master targeting said girl 4. MC asked to accept the girl as slave, says that he wont accept her as a slave but as a PARTNER (?) and decides he will protect her against everything, without any reason 5. The girl falls in love with the MC after 2 weeks of doing nothing but training, the MC then starts straight up SIMPing for the girl, she throws herself at him naked and he refuses because 'i dont want you to love me because i helped you' 6. MC makes a fortune selling KETCHUP recipe 7. MC is forced to hide his power due to some stupid reason 8. Sepration of MC and FL with reunion around chapter 300 (why even introduce romance if most of the time they are separate?) 9. OP sect elder, who can do whatever he wants and even patriarch of the sect lets him to do so, accepting MC and the FL as direct disciples right at the beggining Then the worldbuilding - it's pretty nonexistent, we get no descriptions of locations, barely any descriptions of where they live, whats around, nothing. Character design? It's bad. MC is a beta simp, FL is 2D at best, side characters aren't even worth mentioning (through the first 55 chapters you meet senior brother and medic who are there to only introduce FL to MC, the sect elder who takes them as disciples and is the man buying the ketchup recipe for 1500 gold coins, two bad elders scheeming with the young master and 3 lackeys - all of them just for a chapter to get faceslapped) Story development itself is slow and cliche.

MC revealed history and mindset clash. From what we know of the MC, he should probably be a lot more logical and ruthless but he is definitely not. Also, system is average and plot armor is heavy.

We don't know anything about geography , or cultivation systems or anything at all practically. The MC is a detestable little guy without many good points to his personality.

He is brainless when he isn't using his pre-transmigration knowledge to make a quick buck by creating and selling stuff like soap and French fries.

1.10462E+16,2688866948,holachica,1,"yeah, so um, really f*cking cliche. Just when you think a story can’t get any more cliche, BOOM another one pops up. This story’s got: - The genius who died and then reincarnated into the body of a “trash” - the over-the-top descriptions Ex. Every time the ML enters the scene, there is always a sentence of two describing “his deep, devilish eyes, his seductive thin lips, chiseled features, yada yada.” Like we f*cking get it, the male leads got a hot bod, just shut up about it already. Ex. “Her body was voluptuous, her perfect figure complementing her ice cold features, her jade skin—-l like we f*ckijg get it already. - the constant use of the word “slut”, or for more variety, “cheap slut”, and “good-for-nothing”. Like holy f*cking **** I get tired of reading that every other sentence. It’s degrading. Demeaning. Unpleasant to read and to the eyes. Again, just shut the f*ck up already and hit up a thesaurus. - the male lead who’s interested in her for no reason other than “omG she’s such a cunning woman I think I’m falling in luuuuuurrrrrvvvv~~~” - oh yeah, the male lead also happens to be from some peerless background and has super high status, is powerful, etc etc. - the family of snakes - the despotic siblings who give her hate for no good reason other than the fact that the FL can’t cultivate and has poor potential. - the pay-to-win system where everything costs money and yeah, simply working hard will get you nowhere. Oh yeah, FL is only great because she’s got all these awesome techniques and limitless potential. Whoot whoot. - the unnecessary commentary from the “crowd” who always seem to have something to say. Albeit, a pathetic attempt to reach word count. - the use of regurgitated, redundant words, ex. “heaven defying” Oh, I could go on. Also, I read till like chapter 32 but since I ain’t letting this piece of sh*t stay in my library, the chapter count is 0. Count how many times I swore. Multiply that by 16379257 and that’s how pissed of I am and how done with these books.",1111551791

1.10462E+16,4223488814,LightningCatThief,1,"So I read this and my first thought is that I really want the ML to die a horrible death. Why anyone would think this trash romantic is beyond me. The ML is a child molester. There is no other way to say it. Using higher strength to detain and feel up an undeveloped girl is just not acceptable in any way. Not to mention him intruding into the MC safe spaces regularly to coop a feel. ""Enjoying her smooth skin"", more like forcing an underaged girl to indure his wandering hands. For the FL, our MC, this behaviour is even worse because she has recently lost everything because of betrayal and now there is this molester who stops her from feeling any safety whatsoever. This is the kind of thing that breaks even the Strongest mind and it shows. The FL is clearly trying to regain control by brutally dealing with any opponent while still steadily losing herself because all her efforts are fruitless in front of this bastars ML. My desperate hope for this novel is that the FL/MC brutally kills the ML as soon as she gets the chance otherwise this is only going to get worse. I would be greatly disappointed, but not really surprised if the FL gets stockholm syndrome and starts enjoying the MLs horrendous actions.",1111553810

Because of this condition, he is indifferent toward everyone, and his only focus is to be the strongest.

2.47425E+16,4320110959,BiteYouToDeath,4,"This novel is a 100% must read IF you like the premise. Premise: MC transmigrates into the body of minor villain. His goal in past and current life is to be the strongest in the world. He got kinda close before dying so he has the knowledge making him very OP. This drive makes him want to be the best in everything which combined with his personality makes for a funny and satisfying read. The twist? His condition makes it impossible to recognize faces or their expressions. Of course this complicates interpersonal relationships to a huge degree. Very fun read, give it a try if you like OP MCs. It’s worth noting that the novel doesn’t really pick up until after the prolog ends (~30 chapters). Also the reveal after chapter 100 is just perfection. The best way to handle reincarnation novels. The author also has a trend of not postponing reveals and interactions like many other authors would. Wont spoil anything but if you have ever had a moment where you are just yelling at the MC for not revealing something or waiting for characters to meet only for them to miss each other for hundreds of chapters, then don’t worry about that here.",1111553883

2.43127E+16,4318446290,Blue_Robin,3,"Alright now let me start with this. I really like this novel. It has flaws, don't get me wrong, but I can look past them. Let me just get the flaws out of the way. The writing quality can be poor at times, though it usually maintains a consistent mediocrity. If I remember correctly the author is not a native english speaker, however tries his best with the aid of Grammarly. This means it's readable, but mistakes will be noticeable. The second flaw is the romance. This is a harem. Neglect play seems to be a fetish of the mc's and boy does he not care if everyone knows it. Jokes aside, the mc does acquire a lot of women, and from what I have read in the synopsis there are even more to be acquired. He obviously doesn't have the time to deal with them all, and will likely consistently ignore a group of them who simply aren't near him. He also isn't super clear about his intentions to love multiple people with anyone but this one heroine who also double's as current best girl. Final flaw is a matter of personal preference, and not something that is necessarily a problem. In fact it hasn't even happened yet. Dimension jumping. For the love of gosh, please dont send him to different universes, he has enough stuff to worry about already. Its fine as is please don't. Anyways, two flaws and personal plea aside, the rest of the story is good. The action is fast and doesn't drag on. The main character is smart while not making inexplicable decisions, the heroines are (mostly) memorable and have their own personalities and thoughts. The system, while sentient, doesn't abuse it's sentience to make the mc do as it wishes. There's also a bit of cringe, but not enough to cause second hand embarrassment. The comedy is also pretty good. It also doesn't hide the seggs from you for 100+ chaps. All in all, besides the romance and writing, everything else is solid. 3/5 Keep it up lad!",1111545457

2.04258E+16,4316939469,Snoring_Panda,5,"This is my review after more than a year of writing this book. I will start by saying that this is not my best work, but one that is very fun to write, and from the comments I receive, it is quite fun to read as well. This is not an action-packed story with very high tension and suspense, so don’t expect that. It is more than anything a Slice of life. This is a story about a man who turned into energy and can no longer die. As a result, he goes around the world, the galaxies, and eventually the multiverse to see new things and visit new places. You will see all types of power systems, all types of stories, not just Eastern Fantasy as I idiotically put it up as. There’s cultivation, magic, summoning, space adventure, and will be many more things. In addition, I wish to answer a few questions and clear some confusion/ hatred. Q. Why did you turn him into a Human? That beats the premise of the story being about a Non-human MC. A. I didn’t turn him into a human, he was always meant to be one. I never intended to write a non-human MC to begin with when the idea first popped into my head. Still, in a sense, he’s still not a human and never will be. ****** Q. Why is the MC dumb/ not intelligent? A. When I started, I didn’t even know how to write a mediocre MC, let alone one with a brain. So I decided to go with an easy choice that will let me do some exposition without making it an info dump. So, basically, it was because I wasn’t very good at writing in general. ***** Q. Why are the first 100 or so chapters bad? A. When I started writing the book, I had 0 hope of continuing it. I was already writing another book I had started just a month ago, so I didn’t pay much attention to it. I gave this book maybe an hour at most to simply write a chapter and no other time to think of the plot. As a result, the first 100 chapters are some of the worst chapters I have ever written. I only started caring because it ended up being quite a bit popular amongst the readers. ***** Q. Why does the MC not jump in a volcano and sleep for a million years? A. I get this question a lot, even though it is explained. He cannot just sleep forever. There is a high chance of losing energy instead of gaining it when he sleeps. Besides, he likes meeting new people and seeing the world. ****** Q. Why does the MC care about humans? A. Why not? He was a human too, and in some way, he still is one. If you are looking for a cold MC, or anti-hero MC, this is not it. Just because he’s an immortal, he isn’t immediately apathetic to everything around him. ***** I hope you can read past the first 100 chapters, and maybe even enjoy them. If you cannot, that’s understandable as well. Thank you for reading the book either way.",1111619015

Similar to many other books with a non humanoid MC it dosent stay that way for long. He gets a human body and all of a sudden its like every other cultivation book on this app. It feels like he is limiting himself greatly because he wants to be a human and have a human body. He could ""sleep"" anywhere he wants for a few hundred years and have enough energy to buy whatever he wants but he wants to cultivate slowly for some reason and then is mad/upset when he isnt stronger.",1111618936

2.04258E+16,4311834924,SonJason16,2,I read up till chapter 89 but after the first arc which was good it just gets boring. One thing that I hate is how dumb the MC is sometimes and he is limiting himself. He says he wants to stuggle so he gets the worst talent and body but all he does is just complain how slow he cultivates and compares himself to others.,1111618716
2.04258E+16,4314463028,Gurthang,3,"Cool story with good worldbuilding and side characters. The prevalent and major issue that ruins the book for me is the sheer stupidity of the MC, born with an IQ rivaling the rocks he resides in, he seems unable to think for himself and use his abilities and system in an efficient way. Another major problem is the inconsistency of the system's point system. The value of items and knowledge of things in the system shop fluctuates wildly to where a couple of shovels and a single coin cost as much as getting a fully functional human body. You could buy basic knowledge of every language in the multiverse, or you could get a farming toolset... Overall I believe the cool and interesting setting and universe are ruined by an incompetent lead.",1111553995
2.04258E+16,4317564544,Daoist_BreakSky,2,"If you're reading this I suggest you stop because there is too much bad points in the story. • MC is dumb and not your genius or normal mc type, he doesn't try to think for himself but only ask the system to solve every bit of his problems (like literally for everything, I wont lie just read and be disappointed). • MC chooses a very weak body and unsuitable for cultivation and complains every time when other people make breakthroughs, he complains that his body is to weak and its unfair, and says why can't he have that body that can cultivate fast. Furthermore it worsens because of the fact that he can create a super body that is very op. • MC is not insightful, in just a year he could accumulate hundreds of billions of energy to create a super op body for cultivation that can reach godhood fast but instead he says that he should struggle by himself cause it would be no fun and chooses his very weak body, in the end he spent a few years adapting to qi and increasing his realm in qi condensation, which is very dumb. • This is a novel with a very op system but makes the mc dumb and dependent on everything to make the story longer and give the author money. • Truly bad, you can't be expecting from this, now the novel is already declining with only 3 chapters per week because the readers have long abandoned it 1-100 chapters. If you read this, you'll be infuriated by the dumb logic and long wait for the author to release the chapters. • As I see it this novel will get 2 out of 5 from me.",1111553986
2.04258E+16,4321447348,VXZD_ZD,1,Good idea but it's complete garbage the protagonist is Op but the author makes him dumb enough that he doesn't even try to use his powers and he prefers to stay with a weak human body instead of turning completely in energy as well as horrible where this novel ended up because even though he is immortal he prefers to socialize with a random village of humans and what came out of that was horrible without Telling the horrible character development (MC) he has divine powers that at some point can equate to omnipotence but instead of fighting he prefers to use an ability that literally doesn't does nothing and damages himself making him go into a coma and when humans start asking what happened he starts acting like a 5 year old child and then reveals a simple thing complete garbage with the title you expect him to be energy but you thought wrong he prefers to have a super weak and deadly body If anyone can please send me a story with a good idea like this (of the protagonist being an energy type or something without a body) then send me,1111618557

While people will think in the first chapters why the MC doesn't Just sleep until he becomes OP,it will be explained later. The MC doesn't want to be OP without doing nothing. Just think about it,how boring your life would be if you were OP (Just like Saitama)? You wouldn't feel ALIVE and the MC Is Immortal,so... This is a new world with many new things to see and we know that there is a Universe and Multiverse to explore. I hope in 200-300 chapters we Will be in another Planet and It would be cool if the MC creates an army throughout the Universe with the groups of people he helped because it would be like a Family and the MC won't feel alone",1111618518

The ML is such a good man, heck he can even kiss the fl despite her being scarred on the face (first time they meet, her face was already burned). He really likes her personality more than her looks which I love. For the FL, as usual, overpowered but I liked it more here because her power comes from a price that she had to pay.

Most of the books show the ML as the stronger one in the relationship, whereas, here their strengths are equally balanced. There is steady progress in the plot and it isn’t dragged at all. There are a few flaws here and there but most of which can be overlooked. Overall the story was exhilarating and a roller coaster ride of emotions.",1111551194

At the time of writing I am about halfway through the second volume and have binged one of the multitude of side stories. The writing draws you in, making you part of the author's world. Before you know it you're witnessing the lives of the characters through your own as of you were a part of this story. You feel for every up and down they experience as if you were experiencing them yourself. The characters are plentiful and each is unique with the way they seem to just pop out of the story. The comedy of the interactions of the primary characters is excellent even if you want to slap a certain dense character upside the head early on. If you give the story a chance you'll realize that this isn't your typical werewolf trope and everything is turned on its head as you get further into the story. The author will keep you guessing and laughing everyday with each new chapter that they release. With daily updates you won't run out of golden material to read any time soon!",1111554777

But now that this book has won gold in WPC 220, hopefully, I can answer some questions. The first thing I want to ensure is the quality of the work. I have two years of writing experience, so don't worry about bad grammar or robotic character interactions. MC is neither evil nor kind. He is stuck in a VR game with thousands of players, but his priority is to get out of the game. MC is a novice in VR games (this is literally his first time playing one), but that doesn't mean he will be a total noob. He has professionally trained in swordfights, martial arts, and many more things. The main goal is to survive, Romance and Harem. At first, I wasn't sure whether I should add romance or not, but a novel without romance is like coffee/tea without sugar; some like it, while some don't. So the romance will be a sub-plot here. As for the harem, I will add it as a subplot too. His goal is to survive and beat the game, not to collect girls. There is also cultivation, but it is also a subplot. And Zach's (MC) cultivation is unique that allows him to cultivate infinite MP.

1.52089E+16,4301898362,BobbyCSB,3,"Overall, this is your stereotypical 'System' based story where the MC relies on the 'System' as their crutch to develop and grow in power. Nevermind that the MC has reincarnated twice and have reached lofty heights in one of his previous lives. The MC is thoroughly reliant on that crutch instead of using his previous experience to get stronger, the MC is painfully immature to the point that you think he wasn't in any position by a servant in his previous lives. I cannot recommend this story despite so many 'glowing' reviews to it. Most of these reviews are just pandering and toe kissing with lack of any substance on why the story deserves its 5 Stars. You want my input? Here. Character Development : 2/5 Story Grounding : 2/5 World Building : 3/5 Sub-Plot & Arching Plot : 2/5 Conclusion: Worth the read only if you have nothing else to read.

Instead I got a completely independent book that is very loosely based on the world of the prior mentioned story. This story has an old monster who actually uses his brain, but still experiences new things with an open mind, which makes for a very likeable mc. Sidecharacters are not cardboard cutouts, but get actual characterdevelopment, which allows realistic interactions and bonds. Mc is scheming and ruthless to his enemies, but amicable and open to friends, family and subordinates, which is, at least in my eyes, ideal. Worldbuilding is well done, the very bare bones are from WotMW, but everything else is original and very well thought out. At the end, if I am asked if I can recommend this story, I'd have to say: Wholeheartedly Please read this outstanding piece of fiction and decide for yourself.

The mc was an Abyssal Demon Lord in his previous lives in which he has massacred billions and trillions of lives but 'suddenly' in this new one, he gets so angry if some random person from his clan is killed. He's supposed to be merciless and cunning, so instead of offending a highly powerful being, he should try to find ways to ally with them. Why should he care about the death or attack on a person that doesn't even affect him?

2.29076E+16,4317156169,TreacherousVoid,4,"This story is good, however, i havent seen any reviews really criticizing anything, so ill have to do it myself. First, the author seems to enjoy wasting time rambling needlessly for chapters on end. A simple trimp from a village to the academy took like 20 chapters for no reason, it could have been handled within 5. Second, i noticed that he attempts to make the MC appear smart in the initial chapters but it just comes across as forced and makes the MC look dumber because his “smarts” are common sense lol (BUT because it was the initial chapters ima let that slide) Third, once again coming back to the authors rambling. Each action and even that take place do NOT need to be 5-10 chapters long lol, not ever event is that important and shouldnt be drawn out for the word count. Fourth, (just a pet peeve of mine) i feel that the MC is very naive for no reason. Like not in the normal sense of the word but hes very easily influenced?? If that makes sense. Like, he sees some man fly, and freaks out and starts “respecting him” (even though this dude literally met GOD 5 seconds ago) I dont know it is just weird, this kind of stuff happens a lot.

2.29076E+16,4314669100,Raycast_5,3,"I almost never leave reviews, but this novel needs one. First off, let me state that this novel is by far the best written I have encountered here. By the standards of Webnovel, it is a diamond. It is so good however, that I’m not holding it to those, I am going to hold it to the standards of actual published books. If you judge it as such, unfortunately, the novel falls short. Let’s start with my number one issue: PACING. The novel is slow, tediously, almost painfully, slow. I know some novels start off this way and then pick up the pace but with this one, I feel that is highly unlikely, mainly due to mthe writing style. The author apparently feels the uncontrollable urge to explain absolutely everything, no matter how meaningless. Everything, from the mechanics of the weather to how the sewage system works is expounded upon with excruciating detail, all while letting us know the mc’s feelings about it, and the feelings of the people who built the sewers as well. At the rate this is going, the icecaps will finish melting before Shang gets anything done. Exposition is like sugar on a cake, too little and the cake is bland, too much and it’s inedible. Info dumps can be useful tools when used properly, in faster paced novels they are meant to get the worldbuilding out of the way so you can get to the action faster, a bit crude, but it works. Another way of exposition (and the best way in my opinion) is to spread bits of information about the world as the character explores it making it feel more natural and engrossing. The operative word being “bits” of information, you can even alternate these methods if you want, along your story. What you should not do however is make every ”bit” an infodump as the action of the story stagnates. Overall, the author is good writer, his style reminds me of Robert Jordan’s, and most people would agree he was a great writer. Unfortunately I cannot keep reading this novel, for the same reason I never finished the Wheel of Time, the same reason Jordan died before he finished writing his epic tale, the pacing is glacial.",877080785
2.29076E+16,4300262687,Stire,2,"Good plot, terrible execution. Meant to be a warrior in a world where magic reigns supreme, instead got an MC which focuses too heavily on his magical aspects. His personality ain’t so fun to sit through either. God gave him a crazy affinity which essentially permanately destroys anything it touches (slowly eats the world) and gave him control over beings which does the same thing, but like an endless army of them. Then, after that, story goes down from there. MC realizes that he could potentially be an enemy of literally all things living so he became nihilistic and apathetic. Killing innocents, killing children (Mage children obv) and doing anything to further his pursuit of power. He summons those monsters to get more powerful by absorbing the strongest one and then, without caring about the consequences, allows the rest of the weaker ones to just rampage around, leaving other people to clean his mess. Those monsters don’t care about what they be killing either, so naturally a bunch of villages with normal families also just get turned into dust. He ain’t shy in throwing the people who has no beef with him (and even somewhat help him) under the bus if they slightly do anything wrong or inconvenience him. Almost Reverened Insanity-ish but worse since such a personality switch was completely unwarranted, illogical and completely pathetic. I mean, while imprisoned, he taught someone how to be strong and such, but whilst fleeing from the Kingdom, he had to kill him to keep his identity a secret because he recognized him?? What? Why introduce him all together? To change the main characters personality to an unfeeling and uninteresting robot? (There is more to it but if you got to this part then you’ll know what I’m talking about) Honestly it is such a terrible excuse that after seeing no changes later on, as well as the quality of writing taking a dive (often repeating and worthless paragraphs) I decided to just drop the book. Going off in a tangent; don’t get me started on the personality on some of these mages either, despite the book saying otherwise, they DO feel like a hive mind - literally no human qualities on some of these guys, just feels like robots in general. I wish there was some form of rivalry or something with the Magic academy, or more Mage companions that sympathize with the warrior cause (or any new companions in general). Or anything to make the world feel more alive, but no we’re stuck with like 6 people, the rest he just kills off or does not care about them in general. Naturally I did not cover the entire book, and I did not want to either. I wanted readers to know what they’re getting into. This is not a valiant, brave sword man who would shoulder the pressure of the Magic world so that warriors before him may get stronger. But a cold, unfeeling, unholy Summoner, which so happens to have a pretty sword and strong body that constantly brings out an army of plot devices and throws the main idea of the story out the window cause the author himself doesn’t know where to take it. Perhaps the author wanted to introduce plot devices to make the story interesting, perhaps not. I could atleast understand the thinking in some of these decisions, but the story is just all over the place. I personally can’t recommend someone spending money on this book unless you dont mind the MC being a pseudo Calamity Mage with strange applications of Magic and the sword - with the occasional exaggerated panic attacks when he kills something with the slightest bit of significance, of course.",877088305

2.29076E+16,4307288254,Cobra03,5,"Review as of chapter 630. Might include minor spoilers but I'll try to keep them to a minimum. Short Version: Stop scrolling through reviews and just go read the novel! Long Version: I'll start off by saying that this novel is simply amazing. Stories like this are what keeps me from just deleting the app due to the sheer number of unreadable nonsense it has. Now for an actual breakdown: Writing Quality - The quality is simply top-notch. No grammatical mistakes, clear and concise sentences that flow into each other beautifully, as well as smooth transitions between different points throughout the story. It's obvious that the author has improved in this regard by quite a bit, compared to his first novel (Lightning is the Only Way), which was already incredible by Webnovel standards. Story Development - The novel is slow-paced for the most part, and especially at the beginning, but I find that positive in this case, since we get a better look at the struggles Alex (later Shang) has to go through to adapt to a completely new reality where his life is constantly on the line. There are eventual time skips in the story, which are unavoidable simply due to the fact that you can't become a Sword God without hundreds (quite possibly thousands at this rate) years of training. Character Design - This is the biggest reason for this novel's success. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, is fleshed out in such detail that it wouldn't surprise me if the author one day revealed he has been studying the human mind for over 100 years. As for Shang himself, the many hardships he has gone through and the eventual revelation that he is, for reasons I obviously won't mention here, the enemy of the world (Opposer vibes 😉), have made him resolved to do whatever it takes to reach his goal. He will sacrifice anything and anyone for power. Updating Stability - Not much to say here. 2 chapters a day plus the fact that the author is an absolute legend. Broke both his arms at some point and somehow still pushed out chapters until he was eventually forced to take a small break. World Background - We get a basic understanding of how the world works and how the mages have complete rule over it early in the story and get more and more pieces of information in regards to the powers they wield, as well as the nature of the world itself, as the story progresses. Admittedly, there have been a few instances where the author goes into too much detail about something that isn't really relevant, but that isn't nearly enough to make the story less enjoyable, at least for me. Overall, this is truly an incredible story and I highly recommend it. Truly impressive work so far, Heat. Can't wait to see what you come up with next!",877081264

2.29076E+16,4320584508,yamete_kudasai,3,"first let me tell you that this review contains spoiler ! is it worth your money ? ( coins ) It depends . If you enjoy stories without harem / romance / then go ahead . It's a gold . If you want a harem tag tagging along then it's a disappointment harem - no there isn't . I'm the type of guy who doesn't read novels if it doesn't have harem tag .. no harem ? drop ! . but the author doesn't come clean about if it contains harem and to find out your self . Remember he doesn't say that it doesn't contains harem and to find out your self .. which is a bait to capture more readers . Personal review - 1 -200 chapters all the mc does is train ,eat , sleep , have a mental breakdown , and the cycle repeats itself . I thought of dropping couple of times but went forward anyway . It's quite irritating at this rate . after chapter 300 it's quite readable and story continues to get interesting . And it made me forgot all the frustration I had previously . I dropped at 402 chapter after the protagonist wants to share about orgin of him and his teacher ( they are from earth ) and about the god to others . It destroyed the full meaning of the story for me and I don't like when the protagonist goes around telling others about his secret / Trump card / system / god / reincarnation etc .. what's the point ? it's the only thing that makes mc unique and, I think people who argue about it are people pleasers . whatever is the case I don't care anymore . . natural review- extremely well detailed story , slow I mean extremely slow story till 300 chapter and later story takes off . Interesting world background . Good updating stability . well though story and characters development . if you can handle till 300 chapters . .. you won't be disappointed .",877089379

Unfortunately, the main character continuously shows no growth mentally, and slowly devolves into a psychopathic killer who cares only about themselves. They repeatedly tease the readers by showing a small amount of emotional growth, then immediately revert back into being a heartless killing machine. If you want to watch someone fall into being a villain, I guess this story is for you. I wish there had been a tag for it, because I wouldn't have wasted my time.",877081264

As with the difference between dreaming and awakening, the distinction between life and death is unpredictable and cannot be determined.

I imagine the Translator didn't have a hand in it. Using 3rd-rate synopsis, Outside of Time instead of Beyond Time(but former works too so more of an annoyance than anything) and a very generic Cover picture... can't say this gives a good first impression from the outside, tbh.

Do you like a main character that leaves loot on the ground and refuses to look out for himself because he expects the author to hand him what he needs when he needs it? Do you like a main character who refuses to bathe or wear anything but blood covered rags because he prefers to look and smell like swine? do you like main characters that get good weapons handed to them but refuse to use them and just punch everything? Do you like a main character that shows all his enemies his secrets, but will irrationally keep secrets only when it hurts his own opportunities just because. Do you like an MC whose ""cultivation"" is only described as visualizing a demon head? Not a joke. That's it. I don't. I feel personally insulted. Er Gen has put in minimal effort on this one.

2.20026E+16,4301178976,PandaKittyKnight,3,"I originally liked this story. It had a bit of fantasy a hint to an upcoming romance a strong FL and a system that wasn't annoying. I voted for it and looked forward to it a lot. When it finally came out I started reading and in came the disappointment. The FL went from strong and intelligent to flat, bossy, kinda mean and gradually approaching stupid. I started liking her system more than her. A system she increasingly ignores despite it offering good sound advice and being genuinely helpful. The ML has 0 personality just cold and only has a soft spot for the FL even thought THEY NEVER MET BEFORE?!???? He was saved by her mother and married the FL to pay that debt so not even a real connection between them. Also this story has a lot of characters they just cram into it and expect you to remember all their names AND nicknames. Before we reach even chapter 100 the girls children multiply from the 2 to 5 (adopted) WTH. And the story makes it seem like having that many children under the age of 4 isn't a bid deal because each child (despite 2 being newborns) is ""sensible and obedient"" the children only talk when the plot wants them to never get in the characters way or act like children it's ridiculous and there's no way I can remember all their names when they're basically all the same with no personality and despite being their ""mother"" she spends little actual time with them and the four year olds are ""sensible"" enough to take care of their younger siblings (THE TWINS ARE 4). In fact most of the characters fall flat with the exception of the system which the FL mistreats for no reason. The face slapping isn't even worth it at this point it just keeps getting worse. I'm trying to hold out and hope it will change because I really liked the first 40 chapters but at this point the chapters are way to short and way too bad to justify spending point on them.

2.20026E+16,4301178976,PandaKittyKnight,3,"So basically a super agent with a convenient sub space (that’s never explained) gets magically whisked into the body of a young beautiful mother of two boys (adopted). The OG mom was good but had awful luck and was a pushover. In comes main character with FL syndrome and changes her life for the better. Pretty basic as far as plot goes. The exposition can get a bit heavy handed. The four year old twin sons are wayyy to mature for their age (genius kids are still kids people). And half the side characters lack even the smallest amount of common sense presumably so the plot can face slap. The story lacks any tension because a female lead used all her stat points on luck.I do like the FL though. so far she definitely has a 21st century mind but acknowledges that she’s in the past and needs to act a certain way as a woman from that time period even if it’s an act. Unlike other fl characters who won’t conform and make problems. It’s a fine read if you just need something to read.

2.32612E+16,4305640752,ottopayback,5,"I’ll start my review of this novel by saying outright that Pancakes is my favorite author on webnovel, and I throughly enjoy their novels, so there may be some inherent bias in my review. And everything written below is personal opinion. I have currently read up to chapter 132, and really enjoy this novel as it differs from Pancakes other works like Epic of Caterpillar, DQR, and World Traveling. I really enjoy the balance of slice of life elements that are vital to the understanding of the MC Elayne and the other supporting characters like her daughter Elena, friend Rika and others. Mixed in with the action elements that occur through the VRMMO that is the key element of this story. The main reason that our MC started to play is quite admirable as she wishes to get closer to her daughter after passing of her husband 5 years ago. None of the characters so far feel one dimensional or flat and each adds a unique aspect to the world building and overall story. While some readers may question certain relations between characters I found overall that the characters are very well thought out. The world building in this novel has been developing at a steady pace throughout, both in elements of the “real world” and BNLO VRMMO world. Pancakes has an extremely firm grasp on mythological and fantasy elements as seen throughout their writing and other novels. The hinted possible fusion of the “game” and “reality” hints to more elements to be revealed about the world and universe at large that Pancakes has constructed in their other novels. While having read the other novels provides more insight into these foreshadowing elements it is not require at all in order to understand and enjoy this novel. The pacing of this story may seem slow to those that enjoy quick paced and action packed stories. The slower pace of this novel really fits the characters and the world in my opinion. As I mentioned earlier the slice of life elements and action come together to form in my opinion a cohesive plot line.

The slice of life elements are less overdone now and actually feel like they contribute to the character development rather than just being there for the sake of being cute or filler. I also appreciate that the main character and most of the side characters are pure good as a opposed to the chaotic good of most other Pancakeswitch protagonists. This also means that unlike most of them, the evolutions of the main characters of this novel are far more positive and good for the world and less demon lord/cosmic horror/eldritch abomination type evolutions and skills. There's nothing wrong oth that, we've just seen it done a lot in Pancakeswitch novels. It's a nice and welcome change of pace in my opinion. Also, despite the fact that this is one of those novels where the game eventually merges with reality, it doesn't go the typical route you've seen many times before. It's a gradual process and there's a lot of mystery as to why it is happening at all. Definitely check this one out!",877080644

6.83186E+15,3288811121,Hevveh,4,"Sorry if my reviews are too long but, this a modern day cultivation story, which is pretty uncommon. Now, it's very slow paced but some of you may like it that way since it's slightly reasonable, knowing that there are questions that haven't been solved yet throughout the story. I had few problems reading this at all and it's pretty good, as Qidian chose well. Here's why: Translation Quality: The quality of Qidian's translations are truly one of the best, the editors and translators included. This is always expected from me, and probably most of the readers on Qidian. I literally found no errors in grammar/punctuation and it was all easily read and understood. Updating Stability: The update stability (like always) was always followed by and true from what I've seen. The translators and editors have a schedule and they obey it (5 chapters a week). The translation speed though, could be a little faster, maybe 7 days/week. I say that since the novel is already completed and still has about 2000 chapters to go. Other than that no problems with this. Story Development: The story and plot develops at a VERY slow pace. But if you ignore that, you find almost no problems. If you do read past the beginning, (unlike some other people) you find that it slowly get's better. There is a clear objective and the plot is reasonable and there isn't any plot holes. As the information is also given to you at reasonable times, as it is, the plot is pretty good. Character Design: The main character and some very important characters have personalities and each have goals and backstories. But the side characters aren't really realistic, and girls may fall in love too easily (to the extent of 10 days together = love forever). He easily discards girls even if that happens (for the sake of cultivation) and makes it look like they're side characters, although they aren't, and indeed do help with the development of story and the main character. Which is why this is okay. World Background: The world develops slowly and information is given to you slowly (like I said before). No info dumps and the world development isn't only at the beginning, (like some stories) and it develops throughout the story instead of all the info at the beginning. This makes it comprehensive and allows you to take it all in, and know what's happening. Taking all of that into account, I rate and recommend this story at 4.4 stars! I liked this story and hopefully you do too, just get through the beginning and it'll get better (in my opinion)! Go ahead and read now.",877080891

You have been forewarned. The sheer stupidity of the MC (and pretty much every character) might rub on you! If you don't trust this review then all you have to do is sample the comments for a few chapters to understand that i did not overstate anything.

6.83186E+15,4300281348,AsianLadyBoy,4,"I love this novel and allot of reviews i see are bad because the author is racist against America and Japan. I can't speak much about why he is racist against America but for Jjapan I understand. For the longest time I wondered why allot of Chinese authors hated japan since in there books they always portrayed Japanese people as the scum of the earth, till I actually did some research. If you actually look up what Japan has done to china in the past, you would be surprised. Like the Nanking Massacre aka the Rape of Nanking. During world war 2 the Japanese Armed forces brutally murdered hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians. (basically prisoners). They also raped between 20,000 and 80,000 women. Japan never took any prisoners during the war. If you surrendered they killed you, if you were a girl they would rape you.They even used poison gas on the Chinese (like mustered gas). Even after Japan signed international treaties saying it wouldn't use poison gas, but they still did secretly on battlefields in Asia, they committed allot of war crimes. To add fuel to the fire Japan for the longest time has not even acknowledged that these things took place, even with all the evidence that was stacked against them. Last I heard was that the Japanese citizens had urged the government to acknowledge the World War II crimes. I don't know if they government has or hasn't apologized, But again its there governments fault. Its a shame that allot of Chinese people hate Japan and there people. Since allot of Japanese people don't feel the same way now that they did back then. Yeah it happened along time ago, you may even just say to them to ""just get over it, it happened along time ago"". But that could be said for allot of events that happened in the past like the Holocaust, or even slavery in America. You wouldn't just tell them to ""get over it"", would you. But if you actually listen to the stories of the survivors of this horrific event. It is 100% more brutal then I have made it seem. So next time you will know, why allot of Chinese people hate Japan. To allot of them,Japan is filled with evil people. Its just a dam shame that they feel this way. Over time people grow and change but allot of Chinese citizens still grow with hatred for Japan in there harts.",877080042

2.13712E+16,4301063463,ResidentialPsycho,3,"This is a sci-fi/action series where characters have the opportunity to evolve using special serums and mutate with traits of other animal creatures for combat. Society is largely ruled by gangs, and not just anyone can live just anywhere. The main character himself is a gangster, but this isn’t explored fully. Although he has a family, there has been little world building or time spent with his family members or at his home, so he comes across as a rather shallow character. The other characters suffer from lack of depth as well, and they are quite forgettable. My Vampire System has a similar problem with character depth and making readers feel emotionally attached to and sympathetic toward the characters of the series, but it’s even worse here. The character designs are overall quite weak and forgettable. The story development largely makes sense so far, although not too much has happened yet. Some of the characters don’t make the most logical choices, especially the main character, but neither do real people. Even when there are some clearly important and critical things for the main character to explore, such as experimenting with his physique or testing out his abilities, he ignores these things altogether. He doesn’t make the wisest choices, and some of the planning in the plot is odd but may make sense later on. The world background is in desperate need of being filled up and shown, not told. Although some details have been explained to the readers, little has been shown to them to let them experience this world through the senses of the main character or other characters. This series could improve in quality dramatically by fleshing out the world and characters themselves. Although this is a series about werewolves, it’s clear by this point that the author didn’t do any research on wolves themselves due to obvious errors in describing wolves’ behaviors. If you’re here because you like wolves, then you will be disappointed. If you are here for werewolves and not the animal they’re based on, then you may still enjoy the series. If you are here for wolves and want to learn more about wolves by reading this series, then you should make a hasty retreat. Overall, some people may still like this series, but I don’t like it’s worth spending spirit stones or fast passes on with its current level of writing. That said, the writer could dramatically improve the quality of his series by trying to build the world and characters more.",877086310

The story is unsurprising about a werewolf protagonist from a poor background. Like many werewolf teen stories, it centres around Gary, his social problems and his friends. What keeps this novel from leaving my grip is the world of gangs and gang violence that the author draws us into. Organized crime that has insinuated itself into every corner of alternate earth society, from the upper echelon‘s of government to school yards.

Without a sacred mark, you can NEVER cultivate (which already sounds stupid)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This MC of course gets the most OP, ancient, "",Space and Time"" sacred mark. Of course, everyone thinks it's a weak, class 0 mark since they have no records of it-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This sacred mark allows him to teleport into a dimensional space and cultivate with a 3 day inside - 1 day outside ratio. MC also has the most OP God book full of OP skills . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luck aside, the thing that actually pissed me off was how stupid this author/MC was. He is a PRINCE. ROYALTY. YET, EVERY NON ROYAL SCRUB CAN TALK DOWN LIKE HE IS A PEASANT. No one respects him or his concubine mom. I understand the whole ""But he is weak so duh,"" but to allow random ass clans and even servants to trash talk him, royalty, seems foolish on the author's part. We also have to deal with the Queen (stronger than his dad who is her husband) trying to kill the MC every day. His royal brothers want him dead, trash servants want him dead, evil hoe Queen wants him dead like damn, I get it--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This guy is such a weak, little pxssy. The author states the MC has a space domain and he can see EVERYTHING within 10 meters. He can sense the danger. This niqqa was RIGHT NEXT to a female assassin Zi Qian, talking to her and being friendly and somehow didn't see her reach up to her hair, remove a hairpin that was actually a poisonous needle, place it between her fingers, move closer to the MC and almost strike. Author, where did his sense of danger go? Where is his domain space? Some other male assassin throws a needle from much further away, but the MC of course catches it and stupidly asks ""Are you a professional killer?"" Like NIQQA, OF COURSE HE IS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Later on, we get to learn that our amazing MC OF COURSE also knew this chick Zi Qian was an assassin. Yayyyy, right? No. He still fxcking saves her so many times and when she asks ""You know I was hired to kill you right? Why did you save my life?"" He just says ""Even if you tried to kill me, you'd just die."" And that was it. The fact that she was hired to kill you & you become all lovey dovey with her because you are stronger is just stupid. Like a big sign that says "" ALL THE LADY ASSASSINS, YOU CAN BE MC'S FRIEND, EVEN IF YOU WANT TO KILL HIM."" Like omg, HE WAS KILLED BY HIS CHILDHOOD LOVER IN HIS LAST LIFE. WHY IS HE SO TRUSTING TO RANDOM ASS, FEMALE ASSASSINS? SERIOUSLY AUTHOR? -----------------------------------------Want more cliches? She even gets ""poisoned"" with aphrodisiac powder and turns into a horny zombie for the MC, hugging and kissing the MC. At least the author didn't make it too cliche and made them fùck. MC just healed her without doing anything so yay, I guess. MC wastes 1million silver to buy some slave dude, who isn't even nice. He met him at the arena. This Le guy works for some hoe named Lin Nashqing, that wants the MC dead as well. Lin Nashqing is engaged to MC's brother, another villain in the shadow, the 7th Prince. Anyway, this Le guy was ruthless, killing everybody in the arena when all you had to do was just defeat them. He clearly isn't worth saving since he doesn't care about life. After Le fails to kill our MC, his master beats Le to ""death"" and leaves. MC comes by in a carriage, feeds him a pill, takes him home and saves him. Le , of course swears to be his loyal sword later on but come onnnnn bruh. This dude WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU IF HE HAD THE CHANCE but you want to feel bad now and save him of all people?

For example he was betrayed by his fiance hence when he reincarnated he is supposed to be deceive and more wary of schemes right? That's natural. However he is still has this ***** way of thinking. He hates killing even against enemies who wants him dead. At first I thought the mentality will change as the story progresses but it doesn't. Women do the killing for him. It is so pathetic. Yet he expects to get revenge on the woman who betrayed him with these kind of thoughts. I feel seriously sad about this novel. It had so much good potential but the character development was so bad.

Instead of pretending to be a serious modern system story with semi-realistic characters and a bunch of romance and face-slapping, we have it taken from the direction of a spoof.

1.03851E+16,1035661574,TheAmbrosius,5,"Heres my review after reading though the latest chapter... Overall this story is still in its eariler stages, but shows great potential. The MC as of now dosent quite have a clear goal, but given what ive read the author will given him sufficent motivation that any reader can accept and look forward to read for many chapters to come. In regards to romance/ harem its well thought and feels natural given the MCs circumstances he is put though for his different members. An example, the MC's first girl after waking up in his new bodyhe discovers already has feelings for him. He on the other hand just left his previous girlfirend and is conflicted on how to approach the situation. To top it off the previous ""owners"" feelings are still there and are there to stay. Now ask yourself if you were in his shoes knowing you wont see your previous girl, theres a new girl in front of you that has no flaws you can think what would you do? The world wont bend to your whim just because you still have lingering feelings. Naturally you must adapt given the curent situation and make the most of it. The cultivation system so far is well thought out and leaves room for growth. At the beginning it might be slower then some other stories so bare with it. I hope after reading it you decide to give it a go. 104 chapters are free to read so read those first before making a hasty desicion on weher you like this novel or not..",849543482

They are a superior race and every one in the world want to lick their boots because of how superior they are from other races.

1.13507E+16,722985322,Sinfish,2,"This novel is offensively dumb gamer wish-fulfillment fantasy. The MC is a start-over-from-the-beginning time traveler, with all the presumed advantages of knowing the future, so that's his advantage. That's fine as far as it goes. But the problem is that the author simply isn't smart enough to imagine what top people actually do and how competent they are and why, so his competition is basically dumb. Author goes into incredible detail about how they're playing the game, which mostly consists of talking to NPCs and assigning them in some kind of ancient Chinese bureacracy, and we're supposed to believe that the entire rest of the world of real people are incompetents who are less competent than the MC in almost every sphere. For example, the MC starts a revolution by commenting to a friend of a friend that they should try buying something in the game with real money, which is somehow a novel idea even though it's a ""real world"" setting where people have literally been doing the same for a couple of hundred years or so by the setting of the game. For some reason, despite being repeatedly declared the top player in the world, nobody in the entire world has considered spying on him, even though his general location in the game is known, and any newbie player can start in his region. It's like the entire world has completely forgotten that espionage exists. The 2nd highest ranked player in China, which should be essentially the 2nd best person in China because major organizations are aware that the game is the most important thing in the world, is a prideful young master who repeatedly makes terrible errors, has terrible interpersonal skills, and really cannot be taken seriously. For that matter, all top players seem to be between the ages of 15-30, which is fairly ludicrous given that this is a mangement sim and in the real world competent top-level managers typically start 30+, and again, all top organizations in the world are completely aware this is the most important thing in the world to be doing. The author has virtually no conception of realistic economics, which is incredibly irritating given the subject matter. For example, at this point the game has a closed economy with no trading in real markets - gold is generated by the game when he personally sells things, and items are generated by the game when he personally buys them with no fluctuation in pricing. Yet he randomly decides to increase wages in his city by 10x, and believes this will cause his economy to boom. In reality, with a completely closed economy, all this would do is cause inflation of exactly 1000%., thus drastically decreasing his available gold to spend on items from the system while not benefiting his economy at all. MC has no concept of reserves in terms of money or military reserves - he spends down to zero, and since nothing unexpected ever happens to him, it's no big deal. Despite being a management sim intended to reward people who can essentially run large organizations, MC does not have a single other real person in his administration a couple of hundred chapters in. Given that the NPCs are fairly unrealistic, it is immediately clear this game is absolutely terrible for its intended purpose of teaching people to manage organizations - where I've read up to he rules over 30, 000 people and there has not been a single significant episode of in-fighting, corruption, or even resentment from his NPCs. The game itself seems extremely sh*tty as a method of training people - people get immense advantages forever based on how well they did in the tutorial. Imagine the top genius in the world makes a poor decision in the first ten minutes they play the game which he has absolutely no idea is actually important because it's marketed as just a game - he is forever doomed to having absolutely no way to make up the permanent disadvantage he is given. Also, his management is fundamentally based on ancient chinese bureacracy spruced up with some modern Chinese bureacracy, and it seems extremely dubious that ancient chinese bureacracy would be a solid basis for best future administration, given how it is no longer extant anywhere in the real world. Perhaps even more hilariously, he shuffles around his bureacracy what feels like every other day, and fortunately because it's a video game there's no apparent penalty for making people do entirely new jobs every week or so. Which again, would be fine if you're playing a game but this is supposed to represent a training simulator for the rulers of the future. MC is incredibly lucky where everything goes his way, even though there is a luck stat in the game which he has a 5 out of a possible 20. Although we are aware he is a time traveler from the future and has a basic knowledge of the future, the story explicitly says he doesn't even have any personal experience playing the management game. Yet he has never made a single mistake and nothing I would consider unlucky has happened to him, and now that I think about it, it isn't even reasonable that he knows perfectly how to structure his city considering he never even played the management game in the past. It's like expecting somebody who is really good at Counter-Strike to know perfect gameplay in Civ VII even though they've never played it just because they come from the future where CIV VII has been out for a year. There's really no reason to believe the MC is actually skilled at anything other than the fact that somehow he keeps being ranked #1 in the world. He had a mediocre education, appears to have never worked a real job nor had any real responsibility in his past life, and performed mediocrely in the game in his past life (which he played in MMORPG mode rather than sim management mode). Even assuming he can competently leverage his advantages of future knowledge, there is really no reason at all to believe he has any skills at all, and everything we see in his life that doesn't involving future knowledge cheating appears to indicate otherwise. For example: MC unreasonably spends enormous amounts of money and effort on every girl he sees for not much return, yet somehow this never bites him in the ass. He doesn't even get laid for his trouble, for chrissakes. He's like a 13-year-old who gives big gifts to girls online because they are girls, for no real benefit in the game. Of course all the girls like him anyway because the whole thing stinks of harems, even when he is hiding his secret identity as the top player in the world. It's all clearly an enormous waste of resources for dubious benefit in a lot of cases, and honestly, I would literally prefer if he managed to seduce every last one of them for his harem because at least that'd show some actual competence in doing something instead of acting like a 13-year-old virgin. Imagine if Bill Gates, when Microsoft was worth $10 million dollars, decided to gift a hottie female tech CEO Windows to get on her good side, because why the hell not. And imagine if somehow, this ended up all working out in his favor or something. Nevermind the fact that so many top managers and gamers in general in the world happen to be extremely beautiful young women, which contravenes real life to an absurd degree. Pretty much all his major allies are hotties who are described down to their pink nipples poking out of their braless top. There's literally only two dudes he's allied with, who have been so poorly described it's easy to forget they exist, except for the fact that I'm damn near certain one of them will betray him in the future for no other reason than the fact that he hasn't bothered to investigate their background at all because hell, it's not like he pays attention to his male allies. God only knows how irritated I would be at that ""big reveal"" We've seen plenty of wish-fulfillment MMOs about how people who are good at playing a video game can become the most important person in the game, which may be a real world. As masturbatory as that is, this novel wants you to believe that one of those sh*tty phone games that involve building a city and a territory and I guess probably attacking other cities would result in you being the best administrator in real life for the world. It's made further offensive by the fact that it's inherent to the story that the MC is only the top in the world because of his future-knowledge cheating, so assuming everything goes perfectly for him and he's given mass power and privileges, he has essentially f**ked over all of humanity, which is facing an existential crisis and must have top leaders for an uncertain future. There is zero awareness by the MC that he is actually risking the entire human race by winning the game by cheating. So. The novel tries to take itself seriously with a super-important real game, but the game is sh*t. Everybody but the MC is incompetent. The MC is forever distracted by any girl. The writing is below average. Fundamentally, the entire premise is sh*t. The novel, as a whole, is attempting to represent the MC being a perfect king by having future knowledge, but that has absolutely nothing to do with actually being a good king and the whole thing is fundamentally limited by the author's poor imagination of good management, and how the real world as a whole functions, and what skilled and intelligent people are actually like. Unless you can literally make yourself believe sh*tty empire-building phone games are excellent simulators of real-life nation management and thus can mistake ""highly-detailed"" for ""very realistic"", I do not recommend reading this. Any and all real life experience in virtually any endeavor will derail your enjoyment of this novel. edit: After finishing this review initially, I read another 15 chapters through to his city defense arc and it is so vomit-worthy I'm lowering this to 1-star from 2-stars. Things that happen: Top players continue to fail quests for no reason like 1) gosh, what is a military reserve, or 2) I thought I would win, but it turned out that even with everything going according to plan I didn't have enough guys. He's unsure he can win it, especially since he just took major casualties. Decides to fight the battle anyway because he wants to be first in the world despite no important benefits and he's really weaker militarily than he has been in some time. MC asks random low-grade officer who isn't even a famous historical figure or whatever to snipe the enemy general with a ballista bolt 1.3 km away. He does it, first shot, wins the battle. Personally leads a charge to enemy outnumbering him 4:1 when he's behind his walls on the theory that ""oh their morale is weak, best to end the battle quickly"". Never mind the fact that he's leading a charge into the enemy lines and the whole reasoning their morale is weak is because their leader just died. Never mind the fact that he's supposed to have a low Luck stat so bad things should happen to him just because. Doesn't matter, enemy collapses and retreats immediately, it's not like he's potentially throwing away a won battle or anything like that.... Refused to conscript more troops into a battle where he's badly outnumbered because he already has twice a big an army as he planned to. After battle, recruits bandits into his army because he shrugs and says he'll be growing in the future. Says that bandits are just decent guys forced into dire straits. Neglects that in the last arc he didn't want bandits to join his army because of their generally poor moral character. I don't know what the hell I was thinking continuing to read this a little further, every chapter made me hate it more.",849544112
1.13507E+16,570536481,Dantez,1,"Boring! Yawn inducing! Basically the game he is playing is divided in two game types: The lord gametype and adventurer. The mc is playing as a lord and what he does is basically building and managing a village. So adventure element was half killed for the boring lord game type which involves ""being nice to NPCs"" and wasting time talking to NPCs! Most chapters are just the mc giving instructions to NPCs. The interaction with other players is minimal and the pace of the story is slow and every real character is as plane as a board. And from the look of things the mc can create an army later on in the game which will fight his own battles which I find incredibly silly, the mc even mentions that he doesn't care about leveling up or grinding. Its an MMORPG! Since the start of time they have been all about leveling up and grinding! and this novel just takes that aspect away. Even Ashuras wrath is better than this thing.",849544010

1.13507E+16,4301120490,BookGuardian,1,"I really loved the concept of the story, and at first I was power reading this for hours, always checking for the latest chapter, super excited for news about it, etc etc, but...at some point I wasn't reading it because I enjoyed the story anymore so much as...I felt obligated too? I invested so much time into it that I didn't want to drop it without reaching the end, but I couldn't do it. The story was too illogical, plot holes the size of Texas was everywhere, and I couldn't even get into the hype at the epic moments since I didn't really comprehend it and it's greatness. I'm thankful for the editors and translators who worked on this, but there are a lot about this story that's..iffy? For example, and this isn't necessarily the author's fault since I'm not part of his target audience I suppose as I'm not Chinese, but part of the appeal of this is supposed to be the awesome fights that spans time and space, how famous emperors and generals of different time periods clash wits and might! YOUTH! BLOD BOILING BATTLES! THE SPIRIT OF CONQUEST! but it's honestly pretty lack luster when you haven't a clue who the hell these people are lol ""General blah blah blah"" did this! King ___ did that! Honestly, so many names I can't even tell who is who anymore and at this point I'm like ""Cool bro, good for you..?"" Also I was hoping to see more battle of wit, but honestly the plans and schemes aren't that complicated and the enemies aren't logical I've read like 500+ chapters on my phone not logged in, so many it's addressed later..but....I'm used to turning off my blame when reading on this site but these plot holes are so...annoying? Plot hole # 1. With the rate of conversion of money to in game gold, there is literally no way that the 6 families or the top 1% aren't insanely richer than Ouyang, The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer, poverty charges interest you know. They have such a insanely huge gap. Not to mention other bull**** resources they have. Plot hole # 2. The actual game mechanics are idiotic, and the only reason why everything hasn't collapsed is because nobody is exploiting these loopholes/obvious game mechanics. You can fucking teleport. I don't think people understand how insane that is in a war fare simulation game. YOU CAN TELEPORT YOUR FUCKING ARMY. siege warfare would literally be impossible? Armies can pop up anywhere and in any direction along with supplies, which you can buy from a magical teleporting store. Seriously? If they don't specifically block you, you can teleport your army into your allies base then over run them from the inside, how has this not happened yet? Plot hole # 3, the A.I obviously isn't a perfectly neutral entity. -minor spoiler alert, cue scenes with his sister- Plot hole # 4, they are in cabins which can allow their cultivation in game to transfer to their unconscious body because in case there are hostile aliens on the planet they are going to...Why not have everyone's body be conditioned of the highest cultivation they can have if it's for everyone's survival? It's not like they'll learn it since they are unconscious of it, they'll just have a stronger body...Also Guns and other weapons are a thing, none of what we've seen from the cultivations surpasses hot weaponry. Plot hole # 5 The behavior patterns of the A.I is also illogical? You're taking people from Bronze Age and then telling them to form tactics and plans against modern men? Also why is everyone sticking to the old and traditional old school china government and talking? How do you even know about it besides old dramas?! And when they land on the planet, supposedly you get to keep the AI which you got in game in a robot body and then...sent out into groups randomly to carve out your own piece of lands...? Why? What? They have a united government in that world, but that's their plan? Plot hole #6 Why not just kill your enemies? They get reverted to level 1...I mean that doesn't mean jack **** for those who are just commanders or the rich families, but its not like they'd die for real (Not that morals really ever stopped any MC from killing his enemies), but it would be a big hit, or locking them up so they can't respawn! like god, come on, why kill them then let them respawn and come back for vengeance?! Also why is there magic and other crap in this when the idea is to train people for survival in the new world? When it's supposed to be a test of leadership and skills. Why ancient setting? How the hell do you know what those people would've been like? On what premise is the super AI making these lesser AI?",849543482

1.13507E+16,3728746581,Bunny,5,"If you were trying to read The Lord’s Empire and felt it lacking, this is the story for you since this is basically what it was inspired by, if I recall properly. The skill development, cultivation, npcs, allies, villains, every aspect of the game system are ALL better. I read this one first, so I couldn’t stomach The Lord’s Empire hand-wavey way of doing things. This is a good MC that works for his advantages and plans ahead. He’s smart, hard-working, and puts in a lot of effort to be a loyal friend. He’s also not fake humble or even pretending to be magnanimous, while actually being black-bellied. He’s a good person who just wants to build the best future possible for his family at all costs. It’s also nice that not every woman is placed in the novel to chase after him and stroke his ego by being face slapped. Everyone is pretty reasonable in comparison to most novels like this. You can understand why people are the way they are. The only person that might be annoying in the whole novel is the sister, and that’s just because she’s a Mary Sue, but she also 8, so whatever, I guess. She’s not in every chapter so it’s tolerable! I only got to around chapter 357 ish? Before I paused. I think I burnt myself out a little bit? The story is more technical than some other stories and is really focused on territory stuff, and sometimes that just isn’t what I’m in the mood for. HOWEVER, that doesn’t make it a not good novel. It is amazing at everything it sets out to do. TLDR: it’s great! And has very few plot holes in the novel minus when it comes to the Mary Sue sister. 10/10 great MC, great cast, great rivals, great system!

2.04135E+16,4300816787,moondark,4,"This is an awesome story and I’m really enjoying it. It deals with a shared wife between 5 brothers and focuses on the relationships between the wife and each of the brothers. Along the way, both the wife and all the brothers deal with past baggage and learn how to heal with the help of the others. The story also touches on some darker aspects of relationships but personally I don’t think it’s gotten that dark or twisted yet. At most, maybe a little racy, which I’m all for. The world building is cohesive and the writing is logical and flows well. Some grammatical errors but not too bad. The romance is really sweet and sometimes sexy. Which I appreciate personally. The characters are well-rounded and have their own back stories which develop as the storyline progresses. I’m reading another one of the authors stories and I think she has potential to grow way past the Webnovel platform. It seems like most of her stories try to take a deeper look at the psychological issues underlying a lot of the things people feel, say, and do. For a young author this is pretty admirable. Now to address the white elephant in the room. Early on there were a few accusations of plagiarism or at least copying the storyline of another story of a shared wife between brothers. I’d already read the story and the comic of this other book. At first there were a lot of similarities and a few scenes that were very similar. The characters themselves were a bit similar. But after maybe 40 chapters or so, this book completely diverged from the other. And I mean completely. The characters developed in completely different ways and the story is totally different. The only similarity at this point is that brothers are sharing a wife. So while this other book might have influenced the author as a starting point, she has absolutely made this story her own. In fact, I think this story is much better with much more depth to the characters and the plot. So, no, this isn’t a plagiarized story by any means.",849544070

I found so many similarities in the story like in ‘Sweet Rustic Love‘ however there are so many differences as well and to be honest i like this story line way more so far. At first i fell in love withe SRL but now that I’m reading this i like this story line and characters better. Similarities: Transigration of fl from a modern world. Both woke up to be married as a shared wife. One husand is a hunter, one seems like a flirt, one is limping and stuttering, and one is a tsundere. Both Mls and Fls families are leeches. Both fls are young so husbands need to wait until shes a bit more mature in body. Both fls rely on their past to make money and their lives beter. A few more similarities as well that i might have forgotten. Differences: SRL has 4 ml while this story has 5. One husband here is aiming to become a scholar. The husband who is a tsundere is different in the fact that hes not violent like the one is SRL. When the Fl transmigrated in SRL the original panicked and ran away which caused the tsundere husand to be over bearing and thinking she’ll try to run away if shes not within sight. He also had violent tendencies and shouts although he didnt lay a hand on her. Here fl was so bad ass after transmigation. Although theres a scholar here the one that was more educated in SRL is the tsundere one so the mls have a lot of similarities but its like their traits are spread out between them which makes them a bit different. Also i like that here the mls dont have a problem asking about how the wedding night will work out they are more open. The fls are both a bit over bearing but if im honest this fl is way better because shes not so demanding and gives in to them when shes in the wrong. Here the mls have their mom as the only good family. In SRL mls have an aunty and uncle. Fl here has family to rely on plus her mom left her a dowry and can rely on her shops to make money plus the hot spring they found in their new home. In SRL her parents let her grandma sell her off so fl had to rely on her modern world memories to make money and thats how they build their home and collaborated with a store in town to make money from her designs. I’m sure theres more that I forgot. This fl in my opinion is more gentle and compassionate her personality is on the kinder side with the family she readily accepted. Shes understanding of her husbands and more open to try and make their relationship work. Unlike in SRL shes more mature when it comes to being intimate with her husands, yes she set rules and boundaries but shes also playful and funny with her wolf like thoughts in wanting to devour her husbands 🤣🤭 Shes not a virgin in thoughts, although she cant have sex with them yet we have seen so far that she will help with the ‘heat’ without feeling shy and that she doesnt mind teasing and taking responsibility for her actions instead of letting them up and dry. Also love how she takes care of her mother in law and the fact that the story starts with her life before transmigrating. Sorry it turned out way longer than i wanted but I’m really in love with this story so far.",849544099

7.14353E+15,479008845,FattyBai,3,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like if someone made a Chinese parody of the Fallout series? This is pretty much it. The author pretty much rips the world background of the Fallout series and pastes it in his novel. Some things are rewritten but 90% of the core lore of the Fallout series is there untouched. It's Fallout : China Edition Points heavily deducted for the author not being able to create his own world. Putting a *very* light spin if at all (most of the lore is pretty much left untouched) is bad. Character design is the standard stuff you'd see in about any generic novel. (Harem building, heroines swooning over MC without effort, magical plot device, etc) It is still too early to judge the story as of 12 chapters but all the red flags are there telling anyone that this novel is just another drop on the bucket.",868254301

First of all, this novel has good world background and story development because the author just copies and steals other people's ideas. The author tried to copy multiple ideas and compile it as his own, but failed miserably. Most of what made up this story are stolen from Fallout series' lore, example of which are the deathclaws, mutated humans researched by the government, the project of eden, the fallout vaults, and most of the lore of fallout but the author just patched fallout's lore with other stories' ideas to fit his narrative. Because the author is lacking of imagination or is lazy, he even stole ideas from conspiracy stories, and went as far as using other people's name; Is it that fucking hard to think of a name? To top it all off, the b*tch of an author is a racist himself, what a f*cktard. Yes I am biased because the author ruined the fucking story by adding his racist ideas. I repeat, the premise of this novel is good because it is ripped off of other people's intellectual property, and as far as I know the author seems to not even give credits to where he got those ideas from.",868254239

7.14353E+15,4304081626,JerDan09,1,"I disagree with the other reviewers. First, it doesn't have any world-building at all. This post apocalyptic world is simply ripped off from games and other post-apocalyptic/scifi stories. Second, it's not even fun as a light read because you'll probably just skim over several paragraphs of pointless conversations or descriptions that are tedious and condescending. It's as if the author thinks the reader is so incredibly stupid, and has no imagination that they needed to explicitly describe things, events or every single irrelevant action such as closing a door in the story. I seriously could not understand why people like this stupid novel. But then again, stupid people read stupid things. There is so much racist/supremacist undertone in this novel that serves nothing more than self-gratifying fantasies the author has. I just have to wonder if the author was educated at all, or have ever experienced socializing with people from another race/country. There was a lot of narrow-minded thinking and generalization in this novel that I personally do not find acceptable at all. I personally didn't find any fulfilment or satisfaction at all in reading the chapters. The conversations feel clunky/unnatural, the pace was tedious, and everything that's happening feel as if they are inconsequential in the end (like it didn't matter anyway if this and that happened, filler chapters). Because all it amounts to is just to prolong the story. It is garbage/trash read. Something you read in the toilet just to pass the time. It doesn't make you think or even imagine. It's formula is to intrigue the reader, and sandwich useless, unnecessary things between that and the story progress. Seriously, it's as if the author just writes all the crap he/she can come up with just to stall the progress of the plot.",868254506

I ain't gonna judge it's great 👍, and I'm hooked 🤣and want more..😍 (Though I just judge it saying it great😅) Anyways the book contains lots references from my all favorite game devs Bethesda (naming a few fallout and skyrim) Story wise the novel is moving at a good pace with the mc clearly living the time of his life in both worlds😊. The modern world where he resides and the apocalypse world where he can travel to back me forth . Not much has been explained yet about the device used to travel back and forth (except it runs on electricity and can be a storage place, travel different planes/dimesion/othertimeline.🤔 . Well for now I think he's only gonna travel in the apocalypse world and that basically it. Has good action with deathclaws and radroach and more. Laser weapons and pip boy (has an another name in the novel). I'll just say it worth your time if you like a man in modern world going to the apocalypse world saving humanity .

I'm talking like walk down the street and ninjas attack beautiful women out of nowhere around you where you fend them off with your little toe then sleep with the ladies afterwards while getting calls from world leaders asking you how to do everything because they can't figure it out and everyone bows down for no reason whatsoever. Imagine that then realize that compared to this novel that sh*t is literary gold. Compared to this garbage that is like the culmination of every great work ever rolled up into the most perfectly written tale ever conceived. This is also one of the most ***ist pieces of tripe I have ever experienced. If you care about your mother, sister, daughter, aunt or anyone else of the female persuasion at all you should learn where this author lives then stay away from there because he is probably a sexual predator.

But for the author I say, read English literature, don’t stick to reading light novels all the time, because in the long run you won’t improve your English writing if you don’t have a solid grasp on the writing technique. Also read English dictionaries. And do free English lessons using an app or the internet. I can tell you’re young so you have a lot of potential.

2.12352E+16,4313319939,Asmov,3,"I'll be completely honest here, I want to like this novel a lot more than I currently do. Writing quality: honestly leaves a lot to be desired, grammar is at times terrible. This wouldn't matter as much if it wasn't for the rampant inconsistency of information given out throughout the story. Story development: is very, very slow, again not a big deal, but the constant changing of basic information given out makes it very hard to follow and quite frankly quite tedious to read at times. Character design: I think the concept is good, and I really appreciate that the mc has for lack of a better word ""normal"" family life. But there's little to no interaction with others so far(50 chapters in, and we can count the people he's spoken to enough to warrant actual conversation text on 1 hand). Updating stability: I've given this full marks since I'm only 50 chapters in, and I don't know. World Background: Again I love the concept, I really do. I always appreciate a good system and the fact that there's a system for everyone not just mc (albeit not as extensive as the MCs but skills and rating exist for all as well as stones to absorb etc.)",868254301

Writing quality is average to say the least as many grammatical mistakes and wrong usage to words can be seen. well, for story development there is nothing of a story only a sort summary of his background and what is now then he just goes around training and dungeon running with no human or world interaction... Character design. . . well, at least the characters that author had given importance to are well described and designed but later in story i got the feeling that the story is all about mc dungeon running with no outside interaction. update stability.. .i don't know about this... World background well, it is well described but as we progress only mc's home, motel and dungeon becomes readers world because nothing is told or happens with mc in relation to that.

We learn more about the female lead's family and past life/previous world till 800+. You really need patience with this book.

The romance doesn't start developing till chapter 800+, and this is JUST starting. The chapters before are all about how they are friends and the male lead keeps helping her. Though this is all because the male lead wants her to graduate high school first. A lot of cliches, with some interesting ideas integrated in the book.

1.80013E+16,4302914825,RebeccaJWW,3,"This story is one that is frustrating and interesting at the same time. The MC is brilliant and has many talents, she also seems to know what people are thinking when they look at her. However, at the same time, she is also oblivious to how some people think of her and doesn't seem to be bothered by their thoughts or inclined to correct them. She flips between aware and blind at the drop of a hat. Her family keep talking about how they should trust her, listen to her, not believe rumours, etc. And yet, they never bother to actually talk to her about anything. Everyone is going around with these thoughts about eachother, then discussing how they are wrong, then they delude themselves into thinking that their actions based on the made up narratives aren't damaging. This book is one that I want to read, but every chapter, I just want to shake atleast 1 of the characters. I don't know if I will be able to continue reading because of that. An occassional annoyance is part of the reading experience, but when you consistently want to ask, ""why?"" Or tell a character to ""just say something already!"" You have to wonder if it is worth it.  This isn't a story that if you battle through, you will find ecstatic beauty or heartfelt bonding or soothing reevalutions. So, if you aren't going to get something out of it, whether is relief, joy, knowledge or escapism. Is there a point in reading?  There is so much development, that is can't be a fluff piece or a casual time wasting story. But the characters are vaguely irritating in a way that you can't fully submerge into the story. It's not a bad book. It's just one that by chapter 50, you will be able to tell if you can keep going or if the payoff isn't worth the annoyance.  If I was friends with any of these characters, I would literally tell them to talk! So much can be fixed by it. And it's not even the misunderstanding that are commonly used to create drama in a story. It's basic stuff. How was your day at school? What do like to wear? What is your favourite colour! Come on.

After that, they'll undergo different challenges that are life threatening. It has something to do with rebirth, about changing the trajectory of life (?) WARNING!!! MAJOR SPOILER After the Cambodia, Su Zhilan used Su Xueyi to kill Ji Nuan in car accident but Mo Jisheng saved her life by sacrificing his. Ji Nuan had miscarriaged. Mo Jisheng was in coma for 2 months. And the moment MJ woke up, he proposed a divorce. He was cold. He did not rebirth but he remembered what happened 10 years ago. So he kept pushing JN, it's what she wants 10years ago. But our Ji Nuan is persistent. She kept on clinging to MJ, claiming that she'll never EVER divorce and will only be the MRS. MO. But... Ones patience is not forever... She was kidnapped but MJ only came 8 days later. JN felt that he no longer cared for her, that she's a troublesome. That he only saved her because of convenience. She was afraid. She was hurt. She lost her child. Now her husband is divorcing her. On the night MJ saved her when she was kidnapped, she was in MJ Study. She sat on his lap and DESPERATELT begs for him to just kiss him. But he pushed her hard, away. She staggered backwards and after that, she bent a pen, it means that was her last straw. She'll give up. She went to her office, focused on her work, did not return to Imperial Garden, she returned the key of MJ house near his office. She did not appear in his life. Days after, she was on the club with their employees to celebrate something. MJ was drunk and there's a woman who works on the club beside him, he let her go near him which he never allow before to any other woman. They had an argument but she still took him back to her room in the hotel. She help him 'cause he's drunk. no other intention. But MJ saw it as she's still clinging to him. JN was hurt. She made an ultimatum whether she leave or he leaves. MJ left... That night, JN was laying in the baththub. She did not come out of warm water in the thub because it was cold. The room airconditioner is also in the lowest temperature. She ended up sleeping in the bathub for 2 days? She was only discovered by MJ when their butler told him that she did not go home for 2 days. JN did not woke up for 2 to 3 days because of her weak body against the cold. She almost lost her life. She was so pale when she was found and all her veins were almost transparent from her skin. When she woke up, she signed the divorce paper. She went to UK for the development of her studio. She changed the name of the studio as well.. She did not go home for 3 years. In her 3 years, she experience ups and downs. But she became successful and was even in the list of Forbes. She came back as the President of MN Group. They met again through a series of business gatherings. MJ as the President of Mo Group and Shine that was combined 3yrs ago, and JN as President of MN Group. JN treat their meetings casually. She did not seemed affected. But MJ is. He still loved her. He has his reason for pushing her away. And I think that is to avoid her death. But... After many months, they became okay. I'll skip how. But they're almost reconciled and after their business work, they're planning to go home to Imperial Garden. MJ told JN to go home first. (She went to LA to follow MJ when he did not return and not answering her calls.) but JN insist to stay because she'll be worried when they're away from each other knowing that their enemies from Cambodia reappeared. But MJ also has the same reason. He'll not worry when JN was not in LA. So in the end, she went home. But again, JN was kidnapped, took the bullet for MJ. Because she'd rather die than MJ save her life again. Besides, she's happy dying because she's not alone this time. She woke up months(?) after. She cannot remember anything. She has a brain like that of 7 or 9 yrs old...",844420906

Every 100 chapters either the fl get’ drugged or the ml get’ drugged... u’ll think that after getting drugged so many times they would be careful what they eat and avoid eating outside but no. THEY STILL GOT DRUGGED ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TIME. And when they got a divorced and she went to USA I wanted her to stay there... girl tbh I just wanted the ml and fl to break up 4life! When she went to USA I wanted her to grow her company there and live life comfortably but Nuh uh they just had to get back together. Also when she was preggo and she still went with the rescue team I wanted to beat her up! She couldn’t help at all and would be nothing but a dead weight dragging the team down and delaying her man’s rescue but guess what? This pregnant woman that could help no one still went... even if u don’ care about ur self and husband think about the baby! The baby in ur belly! Think about it and stay home!

And dont get me started with the love making ridiculousness, she has been married in 2 life times and yet every time they get intimate she is portrayed as a some kind of born again virgin who is to shy to be touched and needs to be forced, even though the guy is apparently an Adonis that every female would drop their panties for in an instant 🙄its as if sex it a bad thing and he is the only one who enjoys it, has the writer never heard of the female orgasm?",844421091

I went online and checked more spoilers and realised that I couldn't bear to read it because the emotional investment was too much. The beginning is sweet and all mushy and all that bull..but don't even think for a second it's going to be the same throughout the novel..around chp 350, the story becomes...depressing.. you'll feel like crying. And I can't stand the way ML..the one who was supposed to love her didn't protect her or take care of her when she was..quite possibly the most depressed in her life. Instead, he left her. I don't care if did that to protect her or anything. She didn't deserve that heartache where you'd feel dying was better..I couldn't invest my emotions for this. If you like all this drama, heartache, pain and all then go ahead..the story is written beautifully..the plot..I'm sorry, I'm not a masochist. I'd rather give this a 1 star..but the translator doesn't deserve that cuz they've spent a lot of effort to translate it.",857911972

Just like a lot of these Chinese Drama novels, FL is suddenly like a superhero and can take on even the best fighters in the world, that kind of cliche. At one point when he is temporarily captured in the jungles of Cambodia (I think it was Cambodia) She was pregnant and his entire team of trained underground fighters told her to stay put. They would find him. She flew to Cambodia anyway and made friends with everyone at the camp and then later managed to find ML and save him. when his team couldn't. She lost the baby because she was so stupid and wouldn't stay home. Here is my biggest warning!! He remembers how she was in her old life at one point. He gets so angry at her and makes her feel like s... Then he breaks up with her and she pleads with him! He doesn't care that she made things right in her rebirth. She begs him and he humiliates her. They break up! I kept spending so much money WAITING for them to get back together. After 200 chapters, they still are not back together and by then she doesn't want to be with him either! It's like everything is thrown out the window! This is a long book so be warned that you will waste hundreds of chapters where they are broken up and they don't even become friends during this time either. A waste of money and time. It hurt my heart and this is such a scam. I spent so much money and loved this at first. I thought it was so different and fresh compared to the other Chinese novels on here. I was wrong! Be warned before you get into this book! I will repeat: HUNDREDS of chapters at least where they are broken up and angry at each other!! Not even 10, but hundreds!",857911839

I will try to be general and vague, but no promise. I am dividing the review into multiple sections which each section focusing on major points or issues. CLICHES : Let's just accept that their is no running from clichés. Authors have probably tried all different ways a story can go leaving us with numerous repetitions and iterations of the same thing. Fortunately ,this story has clichés, but author has done his best to not make it a copy-paste of some random CN Novel. And honestly, it's time we stop crying over clichés and just accept it as a major part of Chinese literature. And yes, that was an underhandedly insult. Cultivation : It isn't exactly unique, but it does have few places where it shines. And we can't expect him to come with some new method of cultivation and magic. Not everyone is Brandon Sanderson. ( And his methods are weird but awesome ). The cultivation techniques are mixed and heavily inspired from many famous novels. I won't name them but all CN Novel veterans will probably realise quickly. During the early part of the novel, that's about until Ch 400(?) his cultivation technique was a major subplot. Even in later chapters it is and will play a part. His technique gives him Monster QI, which automatically makes him the enemy of Human kind. Techniques : Overly top names with special effects. What else to say? World : Just like most cultivation world's. Noob Village go Noob town to Noob City to Player 10-25 Village to Player 10-25 town and so on. Basically, the usual. It has its bright spots but mostly the same. Although Monster World and Ascending World's are still an enigma. MC : He's okay. No Rape Guy. No Cruel MC. Not an MC who loves to destroy sects just for fun. Hardworking. Mostly calm. So no Lin Ming, Chu Yan or anything. It's probably not an harem despite numerous girls having an interest in him. He just wants to find his teacher. OP Cheats? : Yes. But it's given by his teacher and not something belonging to him. They are basically top level treasures of that world. She stole them...she highhandedly took them and gave it to the MC. His Heaven Root? Belongs to the Phoenix god. His mind power stuff? It's an Buddhist seed. The technique? It's some supreme technique. Enemies : You have both intelligent as well as run of the mill enemies. Don't expect intelligent MCs at the level of TTNH or any novel by that author. I should have basically covered everything? Any doubts? Post it below. Sorry for any mistakes. Some are mine others are mostly my mobile hanging up on me.",857911649

In the beginning the comments on the live are incredibly infuriating but once you get past the first part they're actually kind of funny especially with the multitude of memes on the screen and fickleness of the characters, the”villains” in the story are kind of pitiful not because of their backstories but because the protagonist is so hard to bully or frame because they basically lack all needed common sense but I have a feeling that the romance will be fluffy but the author will decide to tone down the confident and bold personality of the protagonist and opt for the shy always blushing type personality when around the ml and they'll probably remove the no nonsense from anyone but me character of the fl and if that happens then my rating wo promptly go down to a 2 still right now it’s a good fun story with a semi smooth brain protagonist.",857927282

By the amount of “Chinese medicine” solving anything plot armour throws at MC, his silence till all the side characters fill up the exposition and everyone’s sneering, short fused temper( not the Chinese novel temper, calm, deep, vigorous, spring, autumn, distinguishing gratitude, not being servile not overbearing, sharp eyebrows, and massive hard on for betting at every plot cliche) it repeats all over again.

Our MC supposedly lived that long and yet acts like kid, it's mentioned times how arrogant he was in his previous life and how strong willed he was and yet again act like a kid. Somewhere in the story he get kicked out of his class and he gets shocked, i don't see why a 10 thousand year old Being, who fully knew how bad he was performing and how his teachers hated him gets shocked by such decisions. His background is just for show and never really reflects on him.

Story Development and Character Design, I'm giving both 1 star because there really isn't much of either. The MCs personality and such keeps getting contradicted so much that it makes me wonder if I should take the description of the MC by the author seriously. Side characters also are described in a way it seems like they'll have some personality to them but end up just bootlicking and scraping after the MC and become rather dull and similar.

That shows with all these Chinese cliche's where they bite each other with no thinking. After only reading this did I understood why Buddhism was created there like I say if there is no disease there is no need for cure and as China was rotting from within it gave birth to Buddhism without it I can't even imagine what kind of fate it would have. As for main character it feels like it's average only when it's needed that expert like deity mentality shows up and it looks like that author forgets about it, yes ı understand when it's around friends and family but when he adventure's it feels like character developed but sadly the only development is degradation..

I dropped it than the Polish Magician summoned a tiger and a dragon(900+ chapter) First of all, he is a mage, not a daoist to summon a dragon. Secondly, where are NO FCKING TIGERS IN POLAND. At least make it realistic if you reflect real life cultures into your novel, western culture never worshipped tigers, dragons, snakes or some other eastern mythological creatures. It is stupid, imagine a cultivator casting spells from Warcraft, or witcher using daoist techniques. Also the mc clearly states that he is not interested in woman, yet he still makes a harem, and let females manipulate him into accepting them. Really, you are 10000 y.o., have some shame old pervert. Although I liked the plot, and how he made money, and also faceslapping was really nice. But if the novel was not filled with han-supremacy, it would be greater.

Heart wrenching as Keeley‘s life was prior we see her grow into herself in her new life in such a way that doesn’t leave room for disappointment. She lives for herself and her loved ones no longer blindingly lead by youth’s naïveté and inexperience. Our ML on the other hand has plenty of room for error as he dun effed up big time in his last life. And it’s no small infraction. Everything you can think of wrong to do against a woman when in a committed relationship, the ML has done them all and more. We see his journey to redemption and how even with a lifetime’s experience not even he can predict the future and most importantly the complexity of human emotion. The story is smooth going and very easy to follow. The characters are lovable and relatable. I’m definitely looking forward to future developments with these two. Throw in a secondary ML to throw off the first and now we’re talking. Read all 90 plus chapters in one day, which says a lot about the impact of the storyline.

2.40082E+16,4308739582,system_god,3,"although I haven't read many chapters (only 14) here is what I have found. the story has no major grammatical errors, so it is easily understandable, and the story does seem to be interesting, but that is about it. the pacing is very bad, the mc is supposedly getting super powerfull items extremely fast, which breaks the whole idea of something being rare. if everything the mc gets is supposedly broken, then those things can only be considered normal to the reader. next is the rivals/enemies. the mc supposedly got many overpowered abilities and summons from the start, yet still gets his butt whooped by a guy that is supposed to have weaker abilities / items. so although this story is quite interesting to start, it is hard to really enjoy. my advice to the author is to just slow down a bit, flesh out the enemies, and the main characters allies a bit more so we have a deeper attachment to them. And the last thing is to make the mc work more for his items/abilities, free hand outs are nice and all, but if the mc receives basically everything quite easily (yes the mc doesn't necessarily receive them easily per say, but when he receives multiple super op items within a chapter or so without any real build up. that is what I mean by easily) then the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of the mc getting that hard earned reward, which in my opinion is the whole point of putting something like that into a novel. other than that I think it is still a pretty good novel overall.",876526432

I always review a story after finishing the story. This story had 797 chapters with only 1 extra chapter but not focus on MC's love story. The good point about this story are they don't glorifying 'smoking' and not as obsecure as Ma'am You've Been Uncovered because FL has very clear goal on what she should do. FL (Su Huiqing) is super low-key, she hides most of her ability to the point you'll get irritated because others misunderstand her. FL as always is very talented and has super ability. ML (Yu Shijin); cold, handsome, mysterious and has high ability. He silently supports FL without her knowing. ✔ White lotus friend (only at the beginning) ✔ No miscommunication or misunderstanding between MC ✔ Capable and superior MC ✔ Cultivation This has happy ending but before the ending (climax) there's one very sad moment even I found my self crying while reading it.

MC was the head of mercenaries in International Association which is a house of genius but died and reincarnated in Young Missy of Su family. Slowly she got trust of many powerful people and even got a lanky. ML is sort of commander (warlord) .So we got a power couple. But beware our MC is too domineering and black belly for readers.

The story itself and how it was written was also unclear, there are instances when you just don't get what was happening, it made me wonder if I left out some paragraphs or the translators forget to translate it, which was really not the case, it was just not well written. The characters are pretty bland and they hardly hook some interest in my reader viewpoint.

Considering FL/ML top notch abilities, it either took way too long, or the FL ditch the ML and “took revenge” but basically just pinch the enemy a little and didn’t settle it properly, thus providing the enemy MORE opportunities to cause MORE conflicts/drama. Other than that, FL is the epitome of SUPER DUPER LOW KEY which in terms of face slapping, sometimes her revenge is through someone else mostly her subordinates. The problem with this is cannon fodders won’t realize who they’ve messed with hence they won’t learn their lesson thus creating more unnecessary drama/conflicts. The story is written in a way that it seems all over the place, it cuts in the middle of a scene, jumps to a completely different scene and come back briefly to previous scene. There’s also lack of details, names sometimes mixed in which makes no sense on the sentence. To me it looks like author focused too heavily on describing how cool charismatic emotionless MCS are RATHER THAN the storyline. Basically this novel has MUCH POTENTIAL it’s a pity the writing... could be better?

ALL OF THIS WHILE he discovered an OP cheat of a godstone that he keeps in his room that could enable him to make billions. someone tell me where i'm wrong please. also the conversation just feels extremely unnatural and choppy. definitely fed up with this ****ty story peace out boys",876528236

8.02247E+15,321827453,CreamPuffDelights,1,"First 100 or so chapters were decent. There is an interesting setting, somewhat, an interesting MC and a reasonable but not over powered cheat. In most cases, novels with these three elements tend to become pretty popular over time, and the same should have happened to this novel if not for the author's shitty ability to plan for the future. Like most Chinese novels, our MC here gets a cheat, but one that is barely related to combat, or even personal growth. All it does is promote animals he captures into higher level monsters, that the people in this setting eat, to increase their stats. That's it, the promotion is done over a long period of time, and only one monster at a time, so i wouldnt even call it a cheat really, at best, its just a minor passive stat growth cheat. We come to a point where after eating a few more higher level beasts, our MC practically starts evolving, gaining skills and talents that he didn't have originally, skills that just so happen to be required to resolve the situation. In the first 100 or so chapters, this isn't really a problem and is still within the acceptable levels like most other wuxia. The problem comes AFTER he goes to that BlackHawk place. Nearly every single chapter after that point is complete bull crap. Random tournaments, Random sports, Random talent. All of a sudden, a stupid sounding sport is introduced out of butt fucking nowhere. There is no foreshadowing, it was never mentioned in the past 100 chapters. Just as instantly, our normal MC, with just his base strength alone, displays ""incredible"" talent, for this sport, that came out of nowhere. The sport/competition or whatever isn't even complicated. to illustrate, out of nowhere, there's something called black and white boxing, but when you read the description, and if you're not a complete idiot or water army, you will realize that IT IS SIMPLY ROCK, PAPER SCISSORS. Rock Paper Scissors that HAS TOURNAMENTS, SPONSORSHIPS, worshippers etc. To make matters worse, this does not happen once. It is repeated over and over again. From ""warframe"" piloting, to ""heavy warframe"" piloting, from ""ärchery"" to that hand game. over and over like a stupid as hell routine. From the brief and pointless introduction of said sports, an equally brief introduction and display of a random supposed super talented kid at said sport that again came out of nowhere all of a sudden, the usual whispers all around looking down on MC, the usual face slapping/ ego crushing when MC is suddenly a GOD at a game that neither he or the readers have ever heard of before that chapter, the sudden worship and attention from big figures, the big rewards. At this point, I feel like it's not that the MC is super talented out of nowhere, it is just that the universe he is in, is also occupied by God level idiots. The less said about the stiff, awkward and dumb as fuck ""romance"" the better. Am i salty that this novel somehow has 4 stars and above? not really. i just makes me lose confidence in the humanity.",876529814

I think that this one has good starting point though cliche at start- the typical being betrayed by half-sister and abandoned by her family, I still believed that the rebirth + system + fantasy genre is interesting combination. This is book is also written by author of ""Madam You have been Uncovered"" so I think that overpowed MC and ML is to be expected. But there's the process from weak to strong unlike the other book which started with the MC being powerful enough. The only issue I have is that the author is fond of aloof characters. Which is bad because if the MC is so aloof it won't be relatable and will hinder readers to be engaged in the story. So you have to expect that the romance is well, hmmm... Ice block?

For everyone who love perfect FL with great talent and power then this is the right book for you. You might as well check the author other work as they had almost the same pace and style. The story only has 600+ chapters or even shorter than that. FL : Gu Xiqiao ML : Jiang Shuxuan FL is the most 'human' so far compare to the other FL from this author. She's certainly not weak, but she's just the laziest FL and show lil bit more human emotion. Unlike the other FL from the same author, she builds her reputation and connection along the way. She shares everything that she could share. ML is cold, handsome figure with very respectable background and only warm up to our FL. Well, he only has talent in cultivation though. He's totally an iceberg LOL 🤣 He cares about FL very much, knowing her family is sucks. Don't worry, both FL and ML understand each other very much and their mind seem like connected to each other. The enemy is just so so and they got solved pretty quickly. No suspend at all because the outcome is the same: one-side winning 😁. This story also the least irritating for me compare with the author other works because FL doesn't get misunderstood that much and the problem got solved pretty quickly. The ending isn't that satisfying but still acceptable. Happy reading!",876528298

Not because they are the ones portrayed as evil they are truly one, perhaps there are reasons behind it & fair enough the author justified the protagonists' actions. Im already hooked to the characters. How they both have low EQs yet they show how people change because of love. Not just the good side and the bad. How fickle human emotions can be. How society truely works with all the facades. The way the story was written made me look forward to the following chapters. A clif hanger that I almost cried when I realized reading all the chapters in one seating yet was kept on hanging on what will happen next.

1.6706E+16,4300767804,HotIce,5,"some clarification regarding Mc of this novel. if you're looking for smart or cunning, or jack all of trade MC, then this novel may not be for you. you can proceed with your search and leave this section. that's the warning now it's for the clarification. I have been reading a lot of complaints saying the mc is dumb or idiot. stop with your twisted logic guys, if someone is not smart it does not mean he's an idiot or dumb. I never created the MC to be smart, he just, a dude who never finished his middle-school and has been fighting on the street for almost half of his life. that's basically the mc's background, a street thug who talks by his fist. Drop your high expectation for him to be cunning or something else. does the mc will change in the future? yes, of course, there will be character development for him. He will change as the story goes on. My idea of the Main Character is not someone perfect in everything, but someone who is good at one thing and uses that thing to the top. I have even an idea to use a disabled as the Main Character. anyway, In this case, the Main Character is good at fighting and he will fight all the way to the top. that's it. if one day, I make a smart main character, he would never be strong, but he just uses his smart brain to solve everything which is extremely hard to create (at least for me, it's hard). That's it, while I am here, the chapter's length is around 1200-2000 words, so sometimes you will feel the chapter is long and sometimes short.",876525769

Also sometimes he disappears a week after the month starts without any explanation then comes back a few days before the month ends with 2 chapters and a sad story about why he disappeared. I understand that I might sound harsh but he has done this so many times that I'm starting to think that he's just trying to garner sympathy from his readers so they would buy the privilege again next month.

This is exactly the worst way to write a book. The MC, meanwhile, is a total beta. He's the kind of guy that would watch his girlfriend get f*cked because somebody asked him politely. He's led around by the nose by the author. The greatest proof that he's just a follower is that he is constantly getting bullied by the author to go here or do that without any rhyme or reason, and he does it even though his own character should have chosen something else.

English is not my first language, and I would like to apologize for any mistakes you might see. I have been writing this for almost a month, and there (currently) 47 chapters, so you can see the stability of the updates. I try to update once a day and would update more if this novel gets the top rankings (hopefully, fingers crossed). I spent most of my time on the character design and giving them depth, while also minding the originality of my novel. I don't know if I'm going the right path, but I wish you enjoy this journey no matter what. As a summary of the world, it's an age of modern magic. There are dungeons but there also magic gunmen, flying ships, and other feats of magic technology. The world is filled with dungeons and hidden dangers, and the purpose of them would be explained later down the line. The unique thing about my novel is legacies. They are contracts that transcend time and space between two people, one alive and one dead. The dead ones of the past leave a part of their will (soul) and powers in return of asking for something. The protagonist isn't the only one who have this, many do. Our protagonist, however, has a young legacy that let's him increase his strength (stats). I wrote this novel after reading many of this genre, hoping to make one that doesn't lack what others lacked, hoping for a new fun novel to emerge into the world.

Read the first review to understand the gist of my novel. I admit that the first volume, that is 52 chapters, is not as ideal as it can be. Some people mentioned that vagueness of the novel, but there's a mystery tag so you'd have to stick around to understand everything this novel is about. Others mentioned plot-armor, which I find not as overused as they think. There are many things that are a foreshadowing for later events and everything would be linked together. Anyone who read until the latest chapters knows that some of those events happened for a reason the MC didn't know about. There's some change in POVs that happened early on, but would get very rare later. Please understand. Thank you.

I like the story, I like the fact the MC is not bloodthirty since the start and has flaws, and I like how the theory of the word has been well though. What I think that needs to be improved. Generaly the english (for a non-native) is better than many novel out there, but some passage miss a verb or we go from present to using past and it makes the reading a bit complicated. In addition the explainations of the world theory are sometimes confusing wich is sad as we can guess the author put a lot of efforts in it. The plot is a bit forced and the swich to different point of view/secondary characters without a clear introduction or cut makes the reading sometimes very difficult (but still the story is better than many out there!) The only thing that really makes me furous is to see how cluless the MC is of the world outside. I know he is a dropout but still he must has been exposed at school or home in is pre-teens to all the magical parts of his world ... right now it feels he is as clueless as the reader regarding magic wich is in my point of view absolutely not normal and possible.

The MC doesn't have any real antags yet, except his bickering with Yun and the System. Their back and forths are great. I feel this novel's main draw is not placed solely on Jin's back, he's got a good selection of Supporting Characters, some of which are clichés (unavoidable as there has been almost every type of character) that move the story. And you get to see their views and a small glimpse of what makes them want to visit his store. Even if it's for band name clothes. This, so far, is a novel with great supporting cast that manages not to overshadow our panda, a decent relationship between Jin and his system, and light comedy.

1.10047E+16,4307641870,Jin_Daoran,4,"I've been looking for a good Dungeon Lord themed novel on this site, something similar to 'My House of Horrors'. I finally found one! Thanks for your hard work, dear author! I've never imagined the dungeon lord trope being crossed with the magic shop trope, so this is an incredibly awesome find for me. What's more is that the MC is not an asocial asshole, haha! What makes this different from the average cultivator-system novel? Several things, I imagine. To me, one of its outstanding features is the adoption of mini-arcs for the minor characters. As far as I know, minor character arcs are nearly exclusive to Japanese light novels. Western novels use the technique too but they don't give the same treatment. So, the character development of minor characters in this story is excellent! Even the dungeon monsters have backstories. The dear author may be an otaku, haha! There are a number of references to Japanese fandoms and comparatively fewer to the Chinese side of things. Dear author, Ranma may be the Best but even he will acknowledge the sheer Awesomeness that is Ip Man! Another cool thing: cultivators in NODS are not immortal gods. there are in fact legal and traditional precedents that allow cultivators and non-cultivators to live in open harmony, which includes the fact that everyone in the world is capable of cultivating. Some people just choose not too. I'd almost say this was a way to nerf the traditional cultivator model if the resurrection system had not been included. Yet another cool thing: the NODS shop uses the latest trends in communications like QR codes and NFC protocols. There are a lot of stories that talk about 'latest technology' and yet the most advanced tech they show is WiFi and phone apps. What the hell, right? The NODS shop also talks about store credits, in-store apps, personalized shop rewards and promos, streaming and pay-per-view services...insidious things. No one does consumerism like America! There were even a couple of chapters when the in-store rewards and promos discussion took over the story from the dungeons. Seriously. Maybe not so much description about the shop mechanics and more about the people. Despite shop-filler chapters, the story manages to a modicum of momentum past a hundred chapters, where it again picks up. Ahh, why is the level of tech in this shop not standard worldwide? If this level of functionality can be done with my phone, I will happily never leave my bed again. The initial premise of the story means there's something for every one: monster capturing, system leveling, some food critiquing, some romance, party and raid battling, cultivation, business management, dungeon creation, infinite world theory, etc. The shop logistics is influenced by other store- theme novels here but it manages to exude its own charm. The use of pocket dimensions to expand and include shop services is great! You know, this is the first MC I've read to be smacked down verbally for blindly following missions instead of actively participating in his own life by the shard of his mother's soul animated by the System into being an interface navigation assistant. A hundred and thirty chapters in and no revenge schemes and blood feuds (yet, anyway), which is kind of refreshing. The customers and the dungeon monsters are starting to shine even more. I think some minor characters have more fans than the MC at this point. Definitely a recommended read.",876526632

This story is bad and it is getting worse over time, earlier chapters (until 100) are pretty good and promising. But at some point the author has stopped trying to write a good story and focused on writing as much as possible. The focus shifted to earning money which is TOTALLY FINE. But he sadly disregarded proofreading and story telling which is NOT FINE.",849544240

1.10047E+16,4300460202,MasochisticMonk,2,"While the plot, characters and world setting sound absolutely amazing, I find it just unbearable to read. Grammar is passable, but there's 0 flow in the writing. It's like having amazing ideas but none of the skills to execute them. Random conversations happen that have no relation to the current scene (or maybe just added as an afterthought by the author? that's supposed to give a little bit of insight to character quirks? unfortunately, it's done so badly...) I have a HUGE problem with the pacing and flow of the story (at 6!!! chapters!!!) so while the story really, genuinely sounds interesting, I just can't pick it up. ( T T ) Disclaimer: I'm not that good at English myself, but I'm a very picky reader. It's just how I feel (shrug)",849544204

But the biggest negativ point is the system spirit his so cald Mother, after about 100 chap. Her character is so overbearing that you just can't take it anymore. Than she tell him to kill, and forces the regrets off a other person on him to get him To wake up and take charges of his life.... As if there is no other method out there.... And he just takes it and is OK with it when she has clearly tried and manipulated him. So after 100 chap. The fun and games end and your are trust into a murder fest. I don't chare for the later chap. Anymore his mother's character is just to much for me together with his passiv Betamale attitude and the massiv shifts in the tone of the story in not even 5 chap.

1.10047E+16,4300078920,Valloncur,2,"Short: The Story is vast, which makes it pretty expensive to read, but most of the time it is a good read. The Character makes a 180° somewhere in the early 100s Chapter but otherwise is pretty consistent. Lengthy chapters in the 600s chapters to artificially legthen the story. Writing Quality: The Author is often to forced in his writing, which makes Chapters not that good, but most of the times he gets it done right. After chapter 600 it started to get artificially extended explanations and descriptions. Which serve no real purpose (character or world building) Stability of Updates: The Author tries to hard to match with the requests of his readers to release chapters fast, this in turn did dimish the quality of his writing as above stated. It might be a lack of Editing, but chapters feel about 30% longer than they should be After ca. The 600s chapter. Story Development: The story developes on a steady pace, in my sight a bit to slow, espacially After chapter 600, with to many inbetween chapters that serve not much purpose. But this is not my choice, its the authors choice. This makes the story an expansive read tough. World Background: The World is vast, the author even adds more to it by a method of the System the Maincharacter uses. Is the World fleshed out? not even close, there are still so many Questions about Jin's world and this with 630 chapters into the story.",849545177

The style is similar to Trafford's trading club where the customers' stories are a big part of the novel. However, I enjoy Number one dungeon supplier a lot more because the MC actually progresses and the grammar/writing is overall better.

Kaze is a great MC, and while overbearing at times with his arrogance, is a great blend of charm, power, and intelligence. The character development is one of the strongest aspects of this novel, along with the civ building being very well done and thought out. Though it does sometimes feel as though I've gone through a crash course of economics 101 after a chapter, though its not a bad thing in a novel that focuses on building a kingdom/civilization. I will also warn and encourage future readers to push past some of the ""questionable"" decisions Kaze makes towards the start and middle of the story. Kaze/author tends to hold back information from the reader and other characters which makes certain actions seem strange at the time. However, once said information is revealed it all comes together. There is also a lack of background for the rest of the world outside of the country it takes place in, however at this point in the story it doesn't necessarily feel required. Overall, great characters, good story progression, well thought out civ building, and most importantly, plenty of lemons to pluck. Definitely worth reading",981826248

However, there's a character named Kiera who wins 10 stars for being the yandere queen. This lady insults everyone but the mc so much that she speaks her own language. Literally. She creates insults by chopping apart slang and slapping it onto analogy words for maximum social death. I'm not sure if she's ever repeated an insult despite using 20 new ones a chapter. She's super cute and endearing around the mc, and gets better by the chapter. I love her. For Kiera alone I give the author five stars.",982513018

However, despite me giving it a chance to develop and get better, it continued to frustrate my expectations. If you're coming here, looking for something similar to Full Marks Hidden Marriage, you might find it. Actually, you might find this novel similar to pretty much everything on this website. And it's not because it is cliche or generic (although it is): it's because the author seems to want to include every plot line from every webnovel ever. As a result, the story goes on and on and untangles on itself, to the point that you have no idea of what's happening anymore. The feeling is that we are getting more and more chapters that lead nowhere, that nothing happens to further progress on the story, that the ending is never coming. And it's no wonder it has over 4000 chapters, with how much nonsense this story - reminds me of a Brazilian expression, 'sausage-filling' - that is not even enjoyable. There are way too much characters, most of them alike, that you stop caring about who is who and whatever it is that they want. Oh yes, about the characters: not one of them is believable. And I'm not talking about being unrealistic (although, yes, they are! unbearably so!), I'm saying that they are just so bland and tasteless that you'll hardly actually like one of them - and it's not hate: you just don't care about them. Their description (always long, to the point of causing pain) and personalities are generic, just like any other character of any other novel - the heroin is so pure and gorgeous and talented, the hero is so rich and handsome and cool, the second male lead is so captivating, the villain is so evil and cruel that people rejoice when they fall down -, but it's always so exaggerated that I still wonder how the author thought it would be a good idea to include even more generic characters. ""Oh, if you don't like it, just don't read it!"" you might say. But sorry, I spent all of my energy stones on this novel until it was published. I had high expectations for it to be - even if not great - at least a decent story. But at this point, it's not just mediocre: it's plain bad. This review is not a flame, not a harsh criticism. The author could do a great job with the initial plot, and you can see that the main idea has future. However, as this is a translation, I have no means of reaching them. So, this is a vent - one of my greatest frustrations. If you're still thinking about reading it, this is my warning: don't. There are other cliche novels with better writing on this website. And you don't even have to look around too much to find them. (I might still check on this novel from time to time, just to see if it's getting back on track - God knows my early works are also pretty cringe-worthy - but so far, I wouldn't spend a single SS on One Birth Two Treasures)",982511842

Fine he is overbearing but does he have to rape the female lead every time they come in contact?😤 Is that the way to express affection? He should have learnt from lu tangxiao, lu is rich and overbearing too but he treats ning xi well. Why is rape a sign of overbearingness? Second yuoyuo is pitiful, while the mother is being raped by the father the poor boy is left alone at home and the mothers doesn't even remember that she left a six year old child at home. The little guy had to mature at the age of six cuz the mother is so stupid, I mean the child cooks for the mother😕. So while the male lead is been mean the FL still has to fall in love with him anyways, after all its the plot. The FL is not actively working for anything, her character is slow it just involves her being bullied and then being raped at the end by the ML, she is overly weak I wonder how she survived till date (oh she is the FL she can't die)..

Don't think too deeply and just read for entertainment. Youyou, FL's Son is such a cheat being a certified Mensa genius at age 6, but I simply adore him. He is the main reason I'm reading this story. Of all the little buns I've ever came across in various stories, Youyou is by far my favourite. His intelligence and situational awareness caused him to act mature beyond his age. He is burdened by the need to protect his Mother from harms way (incl his own father) as he recognises that his Mother is rather stupid and defenceless. His interaction/antics w other ppl other than his Mother is shocking and at times beyond hilarious, esp w his subordinate (love this character too)! I really feel so much for this multilayered character! Honestly this black bellied cutie will evoke your maternal instincts haha. I esp enjoyed the first face to face meeting he has w his Father, the ML at the hospital, so heartwarming!

2.20632E+16,4315387313,Alekzi,5,"After writing 100 chapters, I decided to do a new author review. I have gotten a great response so far, and that gave me a boost of motivation to keep writing this; and after writing 100 chapters, I already know that the story is only beginning, there is so much left to write, and I have a hunch that it will take easily over 1000 chapters to complete, maybe even 2000. Second, I have gotten a few toxic messages about how MC's looks, because he looks girly and is around 170cm, so I have gotten a lot of messages about making him taller, etc., and that may happen or may not, I am not going to spoil it, but I have reasoning for his looks and his height, and none of those will change before I am ready to reveal the reasoning of his looks and what happened in his childhood. Third, I have written a lot of mystery, and I enjoyed it immensely. I have given a few subtle hints on the chapters that might reveal why MC is different from the rest, and that White Online isn't as normal as it seems at first, so good luck on finding those. Fourth, I have seen a few theories made by my readers, and I am sometimes terrified of how well you guys found out about some things which still haven't been revealed yet; it is nice to see all kinds of theories, even though some aren't correct, but it is still nice to read those. Fifth, about a love interest. Some of you guys might have read the synopsis and seen the tags, but I will still say this. This will be a No Harem novel with only one love interest, and even if some of you guys like Harem, you guys should still try and who knows, some of you might like it. I decided to lock the chapters only around the 53th chap so that everyone has enough time to read and find out if they like it enough to keep paying for more chapters.

2.20632E+16,4313515988,Ullyr,5,"Alekzi asked me to leave a review as a fellow author and as the editor of this novel, and I will be as truthful as possible. I wanted to read this, as I am a friend to Alekzi, but I couldn't bring myself to do it at first because as an English native, it was difficult for me to deal with the sentence structure. After some chit-chatting, we came to an agreement that I would help him bring the writing up to snuff. It will take a while, but I'll be doing it as fast as I can for his future readers! Daily released chapters will be edited before posting, and I will tackle the former chapters as I can (: As for the story itself, I regret not reading this sooner! Even if there are issues with the grammar, Alekzi has had experience from writing many books before this, and he has truly mastered the art of captivation! The plot of the novel up to current is well thought out, the outline of current and future novel events is meticulously drawn out, and 'almost' every chapter has just enough entertainment to keep you hooked! Isaac is an intelligent (Not a super genius) character who almost completely lacks prior experience in MMO or VRMMO settings. He doesn't just automatically start as the best in the world as is seen in so many other VRMMO novels, and is actually somewhat outclassed in the earlier chapters. As White Online isn't set up like any VRMMO that was released previously in this world, his intelligence and lack of video game experience actually assist him in climbing his way up the ranks from the bottom of the barrell!

2.20632E+16,4319398411,RafaelMitz,4,"(Review 150 chapters+) Positives: The story is very good, with many intriguing mysteries, the real and virtual worlds are very interesting and the game system is great. It's very good to read, with a consistent pace. The story doesn't move too slowly or too fast. Negatives: At the beginning of the work, the author abuses the status window a lot, sometimes unnecessarily. But then he fixes it. I think the care and jealousy of the protagonist's family is too exaggerated. The fascination and adoration the girls feel towards the MC is also exaggerated. SUPER NEGATIVE (ROMANCE - WITH SPOILER): In my opinion the author is making a huge mistake with the relationship between the protagonist and Amanda. She has always loved the protagonist, always wanted his good and cares about him. When the MC unfairly became angry with her because of the incident, she continued to love him, always tried to talk to him and suffered alone for a long time. And after the MC finds out the truth, he friendzones her. He loved her and now the author wants to end it all. Whyyyyy?? On the other side is Luna. The protagonist interacts with her 3 times and in these 3 times the time they interact is a few hours. But that's already being enough to want to arouse feelings for her. DOES NOT MAKE SENSE! and it's unfair to Amanda. Sorry for any mistakes. Google translate.",982512655

He is straight but seems gay for the whole first 100 chapters. He is supposed to be super smart but never shows it. The skills he receives are broken for the first and doesn’t make sense. If I remember right the icy shot skill has a percent chance of working works every time when the mc wants it to happen!!! What is the point of the others then!!! Its just constantly annoying to hear the author say he is a genius when the mc shows zero signs of those traits. He even seems to be dense and slow with some of his reactions. Archers were able to jump along branches within the beginning days and the mc is a genius just from doing the same thing??!?!!! That’s not genius if many others are able to do the same!!! Don’t tell us he is a genius, show us!!!! He just seems like a regular protected child that doesn’t know the world well. Otherwise, love the story and the world building.

2.20632E+16,4314005870,Ali_Bayaty,3,"I'm currently around chapter 40, and so far I have really enjoyed the book. HOWEVER, there is one thing that has been bugging me ever since chapter 1.. the writing style. While I am extremely happy that there aren't many grammatical mistakes (almost none to be honest, which is rare), the author uses far too many simple sentences that it feels like reading a 1st grader's book. ""Isaac likes to sing. he enjoys it. Sophia, on the other hand, doesn't. Alice likes her elder brother."" Of course, the content of the above example is made up, however, the sentence structure is identical to the story. The author needs to stop having 1 line paragraphs and minimise the use of simple sentences",981825144
2.20632E+16,4310128347,EnterGoodNameHere,3,"This review is after reading chapter 151 and as I’m writing this I am nowhere close to being caught up. So some of the things I’m talking about could have changed by now. Alright so the novel overall is pretty good but it has some distinct problems that tend to annoy readers, including me. The story overall has an interesting premise. The characters are interesting and I don’t really dislike any of them(except for the ones your supposed to dislike of course.) The story does tend to fall into some cliches and some situations that don’t make sense at times. Though it’s not really possible to make a completely unique story and for the most part the hiccups aren’t that bad. Now the story itself doesn’t have to many problems, but the ones that it does have show up often enough to be a problem. 1) The author’s first language isn’t English and it’s pretty easy to tell. I personally don’t really care to much but I know it’s a turn off for a lot of people so just pointing it out. 2) In the story the Mc is called a genius by multiple characters as well as the author. This isn’t true at all as he’s shown to be average or slightly above average during the story. (and don’t even get me started on his eq.) The characters calling him a genius is fine as those that do are normally biased and it makes sense coming from them. I would also like to say that this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The mc doesn’t have to be a genius for a good story. There are plenty of good stories with mcs that are just smart, average, and even ones where the mc is a little slow. I personally think it’s more accurate to call him talented as he’s been confirmed confirmed to learn things fast. 3) This is related to my last point kinda but the author tends to make the Mc not realize certain things that are pretty obvious for the sake of the story. For one it kinda breaks immersion and 2 it further makes calling him a genius seem wrong. As I said before, there’s nothing wrong with your Mc not being a genius, but if based on previous experiences they would be able to figure something out either let them figure it out or change it a bit to where it makes sense that they wouldn’t. The worst part about this one is that within like a minute I can normally think of a small change in the situation or dialogue to make it make sense why he wouldn’t know. It makes it feel like the author isn’t putting that much effort in the story when he doesn’t really come off that way. So overall it’s a really good story premise and I feel like if those problems were fixed the story would be so much better and would probably be a story I’m extremely eager to read instead of just enjoying.",982513197
2.20632E+16,1579025003,analyst123,3,"Pros World building Loving family Vr game mechanics Cons MC character is not consistent. He is supposedly a genius but I haven’t seen any such thing from him. Being a genius, he is also oblivious to females around him I don’t mind stories with or without harem. But this one is obviously going for the non harem route with Luna as the fmc but leading lot of girls to the MC. Amanda is not properly resolved",981560395
2.20632E+16,4318369469,I_am_a_devyy,3,"Writing quality is fine and thats a give a way for what the story lacks and the story development is so so, not sure if it will improved in the future, Character Design is a bit problematic, The ppl surrounding the Mc is far from normal, theyre bunch of weirdos that makes one worry, idk if theyre experiencing a mental illness or something, being different from the rest is good but, the author made them off the chart like really. Her family being protective is understandable but her sister being a yandere that seems to infect the other character to the point of being a creepy themeselves is what ticked me off. Idk maybe not just for me but you can also try this one out, might works best and suit your taste.",981826345
2.20632E+16,4300806427,AwfulFist,4,"While the setting of a VRMMO as a backdrop of a story is by no means unique nowadays, the author has managed to lure and maintain interest using the MC's past and the interesting implementation of gods and historical figure significance in the form of legacies - which in the context of this story is essentially inheriting said historical figure or god's legacy within the game. I have some speculations as to the significance of legacies as the story unfolds and further develops, but will refrain from doing so till more clues and hints are given. Also, the gradual revelations of Isaac's past in the form of out of context character interactions, character behavior, and dialogue is a breath of fresh air as most authors like to info dump their readers within the first few chapters the entire background of their main character. The gradual revelations add a layer of mystery that acts as a driving force for the readers to continue reading in order to find out what exactly happened in Isaac's past for his character and the characters around him to behave in certain ways. It makes for a much more compelling way of storytelling as readers have to piece pieces of the puzzles using the clues that are given at that moment of time in the story. There are some jarring details in the entirety of this novel, however, one of them being the constant mention of how ""pretty"" or ""beautiful"" Isaac is. From the constant misperception of his gender as a female from characters that do not know him, to his ""flawless"" skin that the ladies get jealous with envy of. I will give the benefit of the doubt and have faith that this is an intentional detail that the author has included in this novel and that it will tie in somehow to the bigger picture of the story later on. In addition to this, there are some inconsistencies to the author's use of literary devices - namely foreshadowing. Not gonna spoil it here, but it was the kind of foreshadowing that reveals to the reader in a single sentence what will happen in the future directly in an overtly obvious manner instead of subtly giving a clue. The juxtaposition of author's clever gradual revelations of Isaac, the world, and the characters around him and awkward bad foreshadowing is jarring to say the least- especially when the latter almost completely destroyed the surprise of certain aspects of Isaac's development in the plot that I'm sure will play a big role. Not bashing the author for this too much, but just wanted to give some feedback so such improper use of foreshadowing or any other literary devices would be improved in the future and in his other stories. Overall, this story has potential and whilst it got some flaws, those flaws can fundamentally be improved upon if the author sets his/her mind to it. I am personally eager to see the development of Isaac and the plot and from what I have read so far, I would recommend this to all who may be interested when reading the synopsis and give it a go. To those who may be hesitant to dive in, still give it a try and formulate your own opinions as what others may not enjoy, you may love.",982513301
2.20632E+16,4316967240,Yan_of_Salt,4,"Writing quality is very good, very minor spelling mistakes(gendered words sometimes mismatched, couple words are missing a letter or have a wrong letter turning it into another word) overall you wouldn't really notice the mistakes and generally won't be missing any information due to the mistakes. There are some noticeably cringe moments in the book but overall, it doesn't make the book worse. The story development is excellent. The author puts a lot of effort into the story and how it develops. The story lacks much of the info dumps commonly seen in the Vr gaming genre as the story takes more of a wait-and-see approach in understanding how the world works. The story develops outside the Vr world and the author creates a unique world that is not earth to help the reader suspend their disbelief and avoid large info dumps. Overall the story so far is very good and interesting and doesn't feel like a bore to read. The story is still very early in its development but still has interesting plot points that engage the reader. For fans of the Vr genre, this is a treat that is different than other Vr genre books with how there is a real story outside the game and how the main character isn't overpowered or super serious about the game.",982512482
2.20632E+16,4312217650,RuudMM,4,"Read about 40 chapters and had to stop reading (for now) . Very interesting world and the story seems to also become more interesting . So why did I stop? Well unless you like to read how pretty much every side characters (I guess at least once every chapter) are stunned and/or amazed by how the MC is a guy instead of a girl, how he has such soft skin, and how it makes women envious and men jealous, then this will get on your nerves. The characters designs are often also a bit boring. Instead of describing a character based on unique features (like a crooked nose), you get to hear why someone is beautiful or average. In other words telling instead of showing. It is also hard to gauge the intelligence of this MC. Sometimes he sounds smart, like using a rock throwing game in his favour. Other times he sounds like a idiot, like when he dismisses a skill allowing him to shoot through walls without considering any other uses for it like being able to penetrate armor or shields. If you can read past those kind of descriptions every chapter then I would definitely recommend this. The game is fun, the world is great, and the class is one I don’t think is used often. Props to the author for writing an interesting novel, I just need a break from all the trap and beauty descriptions.",981561436

2.20632E+16,4319475401,King_epic,5,"I’m loving the story It is one thing to own a library; it is quite another to use it wisely. I have often been astonished how little care people devote to the selection of what they read. Books, we know, are almost innumerable: our hours of reading are alas! very few. And yet many people read almost by hazard. They will take any book they chance to find in a room at a friend's house; they will buy a novel at a railway stall if it has an attractive title, indeed. I believe in some cases even the binding affects that choice. The selection is, no doubt, far from easy. I have often wished someone would recommend a list of hundred good books. If we had such lists drawn up by a few good guides, they would be most useful. I have indeed sometimes heard it said that in reading everyone must choose for himself, but this reminds me of the recommendation not to go into the water till you can swim.",981825796

The only things I don't really like are the blatant foreshadowing, but it seems to have gone away in the more recent chapters. I also don't really like reading the female character descriptions, as there is a large focus on their curves and breasts. There seems to be quite a big plot that will show its head sooner or later, but I can already tell the main basis of it through the not so skillful use of foreshadowing. The main background of the story is, while not completely original, a refreshing twist on the usual VR stories. Overall a good read, I am excited to see where the story goes.",981824526

The mc father loses his job and she takes revenge when she could have stopped it before. The mc is almost raped but other then almost turning it around on her sister does nothing else. The mc later on has issue after issue from the rest of the family and does nothing other then annoy them.

However, as the story goes on, it becomes a bit annoying how her parents keep giving in to the demands of their family members or how FL has to solve everything for them.

First, MC is dumb.. can't plan ahead.. can't form a stable foundation.. can't gather loyalty.. can't try to learn more about the system or loop holes.. Second, World building is trash.. tons of gangs.. 1 for each street.. then you got 4 big gangs ruling over 20 gangs each.. then you have the army.. All sounds good.. well each big gang can only get 2,000 people?? in the last chapters these guys were dying in the 1,000's so?? ok (Each small gang has over 200 battle ready people.. so.. 200X 20 = 4,000 then you have the big gangs that need to rein in these gangs so they would need over 8,000 battle ready people.. so in the last battle there should have been over 48,000 just with the gangs.. the army would need 2.5X time that to rein all of that in so they would need over 120,000 people so the last battle count for this very large city with over 80 small gangs should have been over 170,000 battle ready people.. NOT only 8,000 people with all the gangs combined + 5,000 from army) Third, The system.. can be OP.. but nope.. in the end MC has over 600 basic mechs but they can't kill anything even when their enemies are normal people.. over 150 top tier MAX level.. can't even insta kill 1 enemy of the same level.. enemies can goku power up.. Forth, MC takes over gangs and then does nothing after.. all that ever happens is War and Pillaging.. no actual planing or thinking..

Sixth, Dont bother remembering other peoples names.. 4 to 6 new names are added every battle MC has.. Lastly, In the last chapter of this (Chapter 60) I wrote examples of how the MC could progress faster and safer than war.. and how he has to personally kill over 10,000 people just to get 1 level 2 soul.. - Rise through the ranks with an elite team (Imperial Guards).. - Become a spymaster (you have secure, real-time communications over unlimited distance).. - Merchant (he's already a gang leader and only needs large quantities of cheap and low grade herbs.. high grade herbs don't give anything).. - Theft (even bandits know to loot merchents and why take over gangs? just steal the herbs and come back a month later there are over 80+ gangs).. - Trade between empires and continents/ sell information (MC has no obligations to stay where he is.. if anything sitting still is his biggest weakness).. - Create a herb guild/ mercenary guild (Level 1 basic costs like 1 herb.. you could easily just create a guild of 100,000 level 1's all over an empire and even if they die.. you get 50% back no matter the distance..) All with less risk and more benefits than straight up war.. Please reply if you can also think up more paths..",981560799
1.83984E+16,3929972640,Rojikku,2,"Read about ten chapters. It's a decent waste of time but if you have absolutely anything else to do, it's probably better. Initially, I was most interested in this novel. Big, imposing mechas and mech pilots in a cultivation world? A bunch of supporting characters to use those Mechs? Them betraying him only to have their newfound power taken away when they lose their mech? Sounds interesting! But no. First, the translator seems to think the plural of Mech is Meches. Which just looks stupid. Secondly, once reading the description of the Mechs, you will realize they're actually androids! It's a completely different concept entirely! Instead of powering up weak supporting characters, he instead pulls shallow and obedient NPCs out of thin air to do his bidding. The story seems pretty shallow. Every pretty woman has died and the MC assumes they are bad. There was no actual investigation done, or questioning. He goes straight into murdering people without a question, from day one, and seems like a pretty rough person. So if you want to see a man, alone, building up an army of androids with shallow personalities, written by a translator who doesn't seem to care, based off of an author's writing I suspect was really equally as bad, go ahead. Just don't expect anything crazy, and you can't be disappointed.",981825082

After the chapters are premium the grammar goes into the dirt. The free chapters are a lure, after you start paying, the translator gets lazy as f***. You would think that the quality would get better since we as readers are paying for a product, but no they are just phishing. Seriously the TL can go get bent. Just because you go premium doesnt mean you can get lazy and drop the quality to bare minimum. Although maybe there are some dumb people who will accept it, how many readers are you alienating because of the blatant money grab? Literally the first paid chapter is so much more substandard than the free ones that it is jarring to read. It has turned a story I was thinking about paying to read into one that I am warning anyone and everyone into staying away from. Seriously stay away from this BS money grab, low class phishing scheme. I already wasted money by buying 10 chapters thinking the quality translation would continue. *Hint* It doesnt.",981824951

He gets a system that's from the game he used to play before he transmigrated and is capable of making automatons to fight for him. So far there has only been the MC taking over gang territory to plunder resources in order to expand his automaton army. There are no side characters with much presence so far and it seems like the MC will be going solo, without in-depth interactions for thetime being. The only side characters are his underlings and they don't get much character depth other than being his subordinates. He quickly becomes a powerful force within the city he's in using the power of the automatons, so there isn't much struggle for him so far. He's not a genius martial artist who quickly levels up, although he does use lots of supplements like pills to increase his own power quickly. Overall, it has an interesting plot, the system looks good so far, and it quickly paces through the build up faze, although If you don't like fast paced novels then you probably won't like it much. Hoping this turns out worthwhile and that there are more interaction between the MC and side characters to add more depth to the story rather than it being only about plundering resources to expand his army.",981561569

The translation is not unreadable but its kinda bad,the story is rushed and pretty repetitive(go to place, make enemy, kill enemy, get resources). The character design sucks, all characters are really dumb and 2D, they are as bad as these characters in old cliche cultivation novels. The protagonist is unlikable and is just copy paste with no personality besides having a ""hobby"" about murder. The world background is really average and is just a cultivation world, even the mech thing isn't original, Mechanical God Emperor came first and does it way better even if though its also cliche. The mechs don't really feel like mechs at all, and the author doesn't even respect his own rules.(First he says low level mechs have no intelligence, then he shows that low level mech being perfectly capable of normal speech and logical reasoning, as smart as normal person. He is just dumb because the author says so) Anyways this is just a cliche time waster novel that hooks in people with a good idea and just exploits the idea throwing around some cliche plots and pointless crap for word count.

2.02574E+16,4301079682,phoenix_8888,4,"From what I just checked out, this is an ongoing story with over 400 chapters so far. The bad thing about that is that it will frustrates the reader with the mini chapters releases The synopsis is good and it will tease the reader into trying this novel, however the reader have to keep in mind the length and the mini content of life the story. Hence all that should happen e.g. with the triplets gift (minor use so far as expected) will not happen for now so extreme patience is a key requirement when reading. At this stage only 2 weeks has passed in that world. My review - its interesting in that its a somewhat double transmigration of the leads with the ML though highly gifted being completely aware of these changes (He's a God) of her transmigration while the FL is not per se that hubby is not hubby which is not surprising. As a couple, I'm on the fence, as leads I'm fine though I do not know much about the FL except that she has a practical sense of being and knows food. What I do like about this story is the fact that the family of the leads though poor materially are overall good people who are sincere and caring to each other especially with what they are going through. They don't complain, they just do the best they can for the family and for the most part the people of the village are of similar mindset. The exception being one particularly jealous stupid idiot that keeps getting plans and words backfired and making face slapping a minor consequence, its actually worse especially when the matriarch gets involved. Future similar minded enemies are expected. Do I like this story? Yes, Will I keep this story in my library - I'm not so sure as I'm not a fan of short ( 4 SS) chapters which with these type of stories though there is daily release becomes very expensive fast and one feels like they are wasting their money.

This character isn't some random heroic face slapping protagonist with plot armor, who makes ""mistakes"" due to being young and foolish despite living his second life.",981561306

With this new point, it doubled his total points! So now he has two whole points!"" After sifting through the filler, the reader will then get to the story, which is about a kid who somehow gets to a parallel world, no mention of how. He then gets a SSS ability and proceeds to use it like a 2dn grader. The next issue is one that plagues most books on here, which is the authors inability to do basic math and add up stat points. A similar issue is that the person or people writing this poor collection of words will completely forget about plot altering statements or changes, one time after just a few paragraphs in the same chapter.

Now the author has the MC extract the ability from that dead person and gives the MC ""poison arrow"" and ""Ultimate Aim"" (an ability that the dead person never had). On top of that makes them both B grade. The way it was all before this was whenever the MC extracted a skill from a dead person he would get a skill like it that was 1 whole rank lower than what the dead person originally had, as in a B rank skill would give him a C rank skill. This meant that it wasn't to much of a plot wish fulfillment LN.

Overall the story is not bad and has potential, however I realise with this I have to remove my logic hat and common sense to some degree. As the FL's standard explanation to her understanding of food, herbs - some medicinal, cooking etc is that of a herb gatherer gave her all this information. Plus considering how poor the family were I'm surprised that all of a sudden the child who rose from the deathbed has such a unbelievably drastic change and skills whcih is quickly accepted. Hence my statement. I do like her all the same with a enterprising, filial and determined mindset to succeed in bettering her life and those around her. I reserve my opinion of the ML because I do not know him as yet but from what I've garnered so far he falls in the cliche standard - very handsome, very noble, very rich, very capable, cold/aloof etc. Their first meeting was eventful to say the least.

2.43214E+16,4312256796,Imcyg,5,"Initially, I hated this novel and wanted to drop it, but I kept reading and when I reached 77, it became my favorite. And I can say now that this is one of the best Harem + Romance novels I have read, but this novel is also packed with good actions and fun adventures. Pros: The five main girls are all unique in their own way. + Nyla is a yandere whom you will start liking around chapter 90. + Helia hates humans and you might end up disliking her from start but as the story progresses her character becomes more likable. + Lia is the ideal wife one can have, you will fall in love with her but at the start, she gives cold shoulders to MC which may annoy you, but hold onto it until the 50 chapters. As the author mentioned, he doesn't do force development and has given some chapters to develop their relationship in a natural way. + Layla is a mystery even until the current chapters I have read. But She is the number one girl and she will become your most favorite girl even though she doesn't have much screen time until now but you will understand why as you read. + Let's talk about the main character, he is naive at first and acts in an easy pushover way at the start but when you pass the 77 chapters you will get to see his real side, a cold one, really awesome. That's also the chapter where it will make this novel your favorite. However, if you're a new novel reader then this novel is not for you. Because Most good novel takes the first 100 chapters to become good and it's the same as this one. It is for those who could endure the past 77 chapters. But I promise you that reading until 77 chapters will give you goosebumps, The best plot twist one can imagine and I got to understand everything after that. Cons: The only thing I don't like about this novel is that it doesn't have two thousand plus chapters and this book doesn't get much support because most people drop it before reading past the 40 chapters. Give it a chance, it's intriguing where this story will go with all the mystery and girls. I hope this book gets all the support so we can get to have a good happy ride.",982513018

1.5788E+16,4300165615,Jazimo,3,"The “Epic of Caterpillar” is the only novel written by its author (PancakesWitch) on Webnovel. The MC is a reincarnated human male who died because of a fever. And he was incarnated into a caterpillar! As a previous Otaku he managed to discover that there is a system in this new world. The system is actually in control of the world and its inhabitants. Through his new life the protagonist embarks on a journey to empower himself by evolving with the help of the system. Gaining many strong companions while establishing a kingdom. The novel is heavily influenced by Japanese isekai webnovels, anime, and manga. I’ve noticed many similarities between EOC and many Japanese isekai novels like “Re: Monster; Monster reincarnation chronicle starting after being stabbed to death” by (Kanekiru Kogitsune), “That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime” by (Fuse), “The Death Mage Who Doesn’t Want a Fourth Time” by (Densuke), and “I'm A Spider, So What?” by (Baba Okina). The novel main structure is based on the novel “Re: Monster”. The analogy between the MC’s (Kireina) and (Rou) is very much the same. Both are always levelling up, evolving and gaining skills through devouring others. Acquiring tons of followers and obtaining wives and children’s. Doing all of this while building and expanding their own monsters’ kingdom. The only difference is the gender bending happened to the MC. Still I could not figure out the reason behind it or will it be something crucial later on in the future of events. In general the novel has its ups and downs but still captivating and entertaining. I always looking for what next to the MC and all of her followers and wives. Also how far can she expand the kingdom and what will be unfold in the relation with the higher beings. And who is controlling the system",981824808

However, it isn't really my cup of tea. To be honest I don't really have any problems with the book. I just don't like the MC much, the MC's values and my values just don't... Click. She is fairly annoying in my opinion, quite often, so it put me off. This isn't to say that the character is bad, I just don't like her. The story is from the MC's point of view so i don't like the story. I ended up wishing she would die towards the last few chapters that I read. So, I decided to do the mature thing and just stop reading. If you don't like something you don't like a something. Doesn't mean that thing is bad, YOU just don't like it. That you in this situation was me. However, before I left, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed the book. It was easy to read even with a few grammar mistakes and thus, enjoyable. So give the book a try, you never know, it may just catch your liking. ^_^ Just so were clear this is a review of the the first 79 chapters nothing else.",981825230

Think of this novel as a juvenile version of TSSDK.

8.44526E+15,2537427969,WisH,3,"From Chapter 1-96, The story starts off with MC which undergoes transmigration into a game world that MC had played and completed. Similar premise novels include dungeon defence and the amber sword so liking those means this novel is for you. Firstly, the story's directions seems just like any other transmigrated/reincarnation novel which is in a strange environment, try to survive as much as possible while knowing the future/overpowered methods. This is how the novels are structured and it is done really well following the adventuring/questing format. While reading ,I find myself interested as there is noticeable progress by the MC in becoming strong through getting overpowered skills and epic items but the lack of variety to the story may make this novel stale or typical if you are looking for something unique. Although, there is signs of kingdom building but it is not yet happening. Score is 3.5 for fast and welldone story. The Character is somewhat lacking as well with the MC's history not being properly explained and how he got into the world itself is unknown and the personality of MC can be supercold in ways like murdering people without much thoughts and although he was a gamer, he don't seem like one with his kind of intellectual mind and him threatening other characters so easily. Side characters are sadly not as focus in the novel so it is only focusing on MC. There are some items that shows the stats and ability but it unused 99% of the time. Got potential but its 3.3 score. World background is 3.9 as it starts off interesting with how there is multiple species and gods alongside different places to visit. The world is going to undergo a cataclysm and MC is trying to survive. The powersystem or class is normal like an rpg but the MC seems to break much of the rule and I always wonder if the world is real or not because the the characters is living and breathing but must adhere to certain game rules or restrictions. The update stability is 4.0, 2 chapter a day so 14 chapter a week which is not slow but it will take awhile to reach the completed 820 chapters. The translation quality is really praiseworthy and the one keeping me from reading because it is really ****** to understand and there is no grammar issues so I can read at one go without hesitation . However, there is a censorship in one of the chapters I read and many information is lost so I did not understand for awhile but it is not the translator nor the author faults. So 4.8 score. Good Job Translator. Overall score is 3.9, above average.",982511240

The writing is very well done with a very satisfying flow and pace. There are no fillers and no repetition. Each chapter is a delight to read and the source of incrutiating pain (because we have to wait for the next chapter). The world building unravels as the story progresses and it makes sense. There is some plot armor but it is very light armor as it is justified by the previous knowledge of MC. The enemies don't talk for the sake of talking and there is no stupid evil person offending the MC with no concrete benefit unlike many other stories. The translation quality is top notch and is stable. We wish there would be one or two more chapters per week but hey, we can't have everything we want in life I guess.

8.44526E+15,1277925667,Daoist_Dan,3,"Don't let my total score fool you, I would've given it a 0 if I let my my emotions control me. I managed to get 33 chapters in and it does have some very minor likable aspects, but mostly it's your generic anti-hero story. And that's its only redeeming quality as far as I'm concerned, everything else was trash. For example, he kills, but never the good guys. He'll mope and deny being a good person while going out of his way to save even the most ambiguously good characters. You'd assume a person who became some kind of God of Assassins wouldn't be super moral, but whatever... It's a story that got its toes wet in the anti-hero genre but wasn't willing to commit. The problems are not always that obvious though, the author tries to be clever sometimes and does things like twisting the mc wearing a mask into some kind of tactic to inspire fear in his enemies(instead of a reasonable desire like hiding his identity). But these are enemies who he'll take off his mask off for which puts them at ease the very moment he decides to finally make his move. The ""Fear"" he inspired served no purpose, being thrown away casually at the important moments and even leading to his enemies hiring more muscle. But no, he wore a mask to inspire fear and not because he's worried about being identified. What kind of b*tch made loser cares about that kind of thing right? He'll also have this so called ""expert"" make ******* mistakes like hiding from people he should know he can't hide from, or turning fights that should leverage his skill and experience into predictable fights of attrition or some kind of retarded willpower d*ck measuring contest. He'll walk into death traps he's been to before and not bring good holy water(Makes sense if you've read it)... He had money, he knew he needed holy water, and he had means to get holy water. But he won't buy any and will instead complain about not having good holy water. Basically, expect his past experiences to mean nothing and for his supposed wisdom to be nerfed the very moment it's convenient to do so. When he's out doing stuff he'll bump into women in distress without f*cking fail. Whether that be little girls, slave girls, swindlers who's intentions he doesn't know, etc. Doesn't matter what he's doing or where he is, even if he's in the middle of a troll infested forest he'll somehow meet a girl. The author seems to think that by default anything that has breasts is innocent. The mc doesn't give men the benefit of the doubt, he'll just cut your f*cking throat and be done with you. But a girl who's lied and swindled your family before? One who's been thrown in an actual prison for her crimes? This total stranger who just so happens to be a girl? ""She just hasn't 'found' herself yet"" is what the story will try and tell you lol. And potentially worst of all... Drum roll please... He actually thinks a Ranger class is a Jack of all trades class! Like what the actual f*ck Mr. author? I'm dead serious, the main character is a Ranger and he hasn't so much as looked at a bow and arrow. He instead runs forward and fights his enemies close up like a good little assassin with his twin daggers and various other assassin skills/tactics. And it all makes sense in the authors tiny mind because the Ranger class is a Jack of all trades class! Forget stuff like traps, good long distance eyesight, horse back riding, bow and arrow skills, tracking, etc. A ranger doesn't need those things, and in fact the mc will disdain the very idea, nay, the very concept of learning those skills. He will instead run around acting 100% like an assassin and you're fully expected to believe he's a Ranger. Again, like what the actual f*ck? You played yourself Mr. Author. *Hands over door hinges* P.S. Bonus points for whoever got that last bit :)",981824592

Updates aren't a factor as I am posting this after finishing the first 20 chapters uploaded. The story is so far not super interesting, the first 16 or so chapters are actually just terrible, but it started to pick up a bit near the end of the first 20. Character designs are not good. There's nothing interesting about the main character besides the fact that they're strong, and even then their strength isn't something displayed in a special or intriguing way, they're just boring, and for a novel which is supposed to revolve around character rather than action, this does a very poor job. World background is fine, but once again, nothing special but competent at the very least somewhat. Overall, from my point leaving off at chapter 20, it may be a novel worth reading. As I stated before, the first 16 or so chapters are almost garbage, but it does start to get slightly more interesting in the last few of the first 20 chapters, and depending on if it continues to get slightly better than it is, it would barely be worth reading, but if it gets quite a bit better, then it definitely will be worth the read.

9.32072E+15,279550753,Henyee,5,"Daily Life of the Immortal King is a unique and engaging novel in several respects. While set in a world where technology and cultivation work hand-in-hand, its modern-day setting is something that readers can relate to. At the same time, it’s replete with popular culture references and memes and buzzwords that are like Easter Eggs to delight anyone who recognizes them. But the more you read, the more you’ll realise how the novel stands on its merits. It starts off as a slice-of-life that evolves into a quick-paced plot as more and more characters are introduced and the protagonist becomes unwittingly and reluctantly drawn in. Also, by now you can probably tell that this novel is just ridiculously funny. You will giggle at some of the in-jokes, and laugh out loud at some of the absurd plot twists. It touches on familiar, popular trends like live-streaming and online gaming, and use them to amusing effect in this novel.   The super MC himself is hilarious in how he tries to live a low-key life and keep his powers under wra**. But circumstances and other characters conspire against him. And the cast of characters are a real mixed bunch; from the MC’s long-suffering parents to Great Death-Courting Senior and his sense of justice to Odd Zhuo and his ineffable luck, there is always something to love (or love to hate!) about the characters. Also given how more and more characters start to show up, the translators have decided to stick with name translations that will be easier to remember and which in most cases reflect the characters’ personalities themselves.",982513095

Unfortunately, none of that matters because the bad parts are remminded to readers on every page. What are the bad parts? Well, the most glaring of all, the age of the characters. The freshmen are supposed to be around 23, and everyone else is older, some even over a hundred years. As someone who is in their mid-20s, has college under their belt, and job, if I met one of these ""20-something"" characters, I would ask for their IDs, because they act and think like teenagers who are not old enough to drink yet. The ***** world is a balance of polite patience and respect for society. From the way the characters behave, none of them seem to have ever worked or studied. Like little children, they jump at the idea that they are superior to others if they have a talent or a high points... they brag about it and shun those who are lower from the start (first day when they know nothing and second day when they know 5% more). They cat called a lecturer... wtf? That is like catcalling your boss, the person in whose hands is a button: make your life hell. Piss off a professor, you might as well leave the university for passing their subject would be close to zero. They can feel and think all these things, but only an imbecile would show it outwardly. Some of them are ""smart"" yet act like children. If they were kids 14 years old it would fine to read, but knowing they are my age and... act like having never left their mother's side - embarrassing. This novel would be easier to read for those who are teenagers themselves because they wouldn't notice the discrepancy in character mental age.

I knew it was a Cultivation Novel and also that it would be my second such novel. What I didn't expect was to come to enjoy it as much as I did. From page one, the story pulled me in and dragged me along on a wild ride that I won't soon forget. I'll admit it was a bit slow to get started, (only for the first few chapters 3 tops) and I might be singing its praises a little too much. That said, once the journey really gets rolling it never fails to entertain. Several times I was left with my jaw hanging loosely and my mind racing as I tried to figure out how Gravis was going to come out of this one on top. Other times I was left simply speechless at the developments that went down. The characters all seem pretty fleshed out and solid. There isn't as much character detail as I'm used to, but that's not really much of a complaint at all. In ways, it helps speed the story along, while also allowing me to fabricate images of these characters all on my own. Gravis as the main character is interesting as well. Watching the way his logic and thinking have changed over these, (almost 200) chapters has been quite fun to watch. Updates have been consistent and almost always on time so no complaints there at all. Really not an issue if you're concerned about having to wait for further developments. The world is where things get a bit iffy for me. Is it solid enough for the story to work? Absolutely! However, I personally find the lack of certain details to be an issue. I love world-building and while there is indeed some in this story, I want to know more about certain things. That though is only a personal qualm and has no real bearing on my opinion of this novel. All in all, I would definitely suggest giving this Novel a read. The author works hard and has only improved on his storytelling abilities as this tale has gone on. I'm giving this Novel a Solid 4.6 but if I ignore my personal issues with this novel, (and that's easy to do) its a Complete 5 Star rating!",981560971

It happens again and again. The main thing that is making me drop is the whole heaven, bad luck thing. I mean I get it I really do but you don't have to mention it and go on and on about it every single chapter. Plus it's used in the most random ways just to make you remember again that it is there. Like when he was chasing the bandits, It was funny. He was having fun. He was heading to the city anyway, and this is just fun on the way. But then it is made out that it was heaven affecting him??? WTF how??? how will chasing bandits along the road you already have to walk affect his cultivation or will? As long as he remembers his goal and strives for it, he can do whatever tf he wants. Just because he isn't moaning and complaining about it and isn't focusing on breaking free 24/7 doesn't mean it will weaken his will... It's honestly annoying to read about every chapter. Then you have how can heaven even atk him like these situations... It was made out very clearly that all heaven would do is not give him luck. Okay so in random situations it is always the worst case. SO how is heaven making him chase bandits? It shouldn't be able to do that... Plus, how will heaven even affect the mc's luck? We call it luck but luck shouldn't be a concept to heaven. Also, if the mc always had no luck then he wouldn't survive at all. Bad luck is like when he is cultivating something can go wrong and die. Never find love etc It will be impossible for the mc to even live let alone cultivate. Also if heaven is fair why is it taking the luck of the family? It killing random people, animals etc trying to kill the mc. How would that be fair to the other people and animals???? It would be much better if heaven was made out to be a person.

It isn't that the story doesn't make sense. The story is fairly well written with consistent updates. The pace of the story moves along at a good clip as well. The issue really comes down to the character design and world background. Both of these are intrinsically linked due to the primary antagonist, Heaven, also being an integral part of the world design itself. It just isn't fun to read. Who cares if the MC is overpowered if things are manipulated by Heaven so that he never has a real challenge? Who cares if the MC's Dad is one of the strongest beings in creation if he just allows the other strongest beings to harass and ultimately kill his children? Who cares about the MCs goals if he destroys himself in the process? The entire time I was reading I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop, for it to feel like the MC was actually making progress. After 100+ I am done. The story is just depressing and not fun. You know that every time he gets close to someone they are going to die or have their life ruined. You know he is never going to stumble upon something interesting unless the purpose of stumbling on it is to hurt him.

1.75355E+16,4313849105,Trial_of_Humanity,4,"As someone who read the whole novel, I'll give out 4.8 stars. The Writing Quality is perfect. Well, I can't say much on it as someone who doesn't naturally speak english, but it was perfectly understandable for me. And even if there were errors and misspellings, they were quickly corrected as soon as possible. Story Development? That one deserves some praise-worthy claps! Wuxia? Xianxia? The search of Immortality? Dao? The understanding of medicine? Get that stuff outta here! This novel makes a twist out of everything that would be considered cliches! Immortality is actually achievable, the dao can be actually understood! The elements of the beginning matter even in the end, and the elements of the end explains everything about the beginning! Everything makes sense once you read the whole novel, and you will not regret it, I can assure you that. So, before reading the novel, don't assume that what you know from the other cultivation novels will help you here, because you will be as lost as an American in a vegetarian bar. Character Design... Well, it's excellent! Our protagonist, Gravis, goes all the way through the emotional spectrum, starting as a naive kid before trying to harden himself to prepare for the world of cultivation, before he actually matures. Everyone makes mistakes, and Gravis is no exception, but it's because of the mistakes he makes that he grows up after understanding and learning how to deal with them. You will rarely see a protagonist with a personality as excellent as Gravis among the novels here in Webnovel, in my opinion. However, while I want to assign 5 stars here like in the rest, I have to take off a point because that's as far as it goes for Gravis. As for the side characters, I have to admit that they all were written with a plan in mind, the author knew what to write for each of them and perfectly shaped them as he wanted. However, to be honest, I think the author could have done more with them, but it's fine as long as the novel is good, which it is. Updating Stability? Well, it was 2 chapters a day like the majority of the novels here, what else can I say? Except at the end, when the author had to send out 1 chapter every 2 days due to some deals with WN itself for a certain in-app event, the author respected his timeline. World Background? Absolutely outstanding! This cultivation world can truly be called unique, and you can't tell me otherwise without reading the novel first! We have all the tools to understand the whole world, along with some details that gives us a clear sight of how the world looks like. As for everything else in the sidelines? That's open for interpretation. But they are on the sidelines because they don't truly matter, you can consider them at most as filler. All in all, I truly appreciate the time I spent with the novel and the author. I enjoyed reading about Gravis' journey across all the four worlds, and seeing the ups and downs of his adventures. Whether it was when Gravis was heavily injured because of unique circumstances, whether that happened during a hard fight, whether he spent his time by himself getting stronger, whether it was when he found his friends and lover, whether it was when he dealt with his father, the Opposer, and the Highest Heaven... As a reader, I can definitely say that I am satisfied with this novel, from the start to the end. I will be reading Sword God in a World of Magic now, a novel made by the same author. For anyone reading this and actually liking the novel, I'll be waiting for you in there. Goodbye, Gravis and everyone, it was a pleasure to read about your story.",982512981
1.75355E+16,4300750349,rockinroll39,4,"pretty solid novel, some people bash it for the fact that the ""bad luck"" part of the novel is all heaven's fault, and yes it is, but that's part of the novel. it isn't some random bs that he just blames it out of nowhere, it's part of the main characters ""gravis"" background. it's something his entire family has to deal with, not just him, so I see it as just another element of the story that adds something else to make it less boring. This story isn't repetitive either, it's not just ""go to new place, make someone mad, get their family/master involved, then whole sect, destroy sect, go to new area, repeat"" when the enemy is the world itself, instead of trouble popping up randomly, it's instead finding allies and friends that is random since the mc has to assume the world is against him. overall, this novel has some pretty good development and story elements to it and takes a very different approach to cultivation compared to other novels, and is worth the time to read it.",981561328

This man’s motivation is weird, he wants to cultivate to get strength and seems to attribute every problem of his to “being to weak” like he for real says that about anything. Also the dialogue is wack and they talk like they’re in modern era. Also, and my biggest problem with this is that he doesnt have enough hate in his heart, going back to his weak motivation. It seems very choppy like his motivation is rarely brought up and you cant really feel his hate for Heaven. He wants to gain strength because Heaven created his best friend with a short life span and because of this he wants to gain strength so no one can do anything like that again. STUPID! And his dad the so called “Opposer” heavens equal could do nothing, really 🙄. Like how can you match Heaven in a fight and not in anything else.

Updating Stability- I usually give 5 stars for this category if it’s 7 or more chapters, but we get 14 daily chapters! 10(+10)/10.

And the satisfaction of watching Gravis grow was great. 9/10, but since you can’t rate like that, I’ll round up to 10/10 Character Design- 100/10, the characters are logical, they talk, act and feel like real people and they are amazing, one of the best parts of this book! World Background- Loved it, and everything was explained in heavy detail, you can tell the author spent a lot of time on it. 9/10.

To put it simply, so far, the content is quite exceptional for an original novel and deserves praise. To the author, I would like to say, keep it up, I enjoy this very much for it's quality. To explain in more detail, there are several points of highlights. Firstly, I feel that the sense of character and personality of the MC and even side characters are well thought out and each behave and converse in the way one would expect them to considering their circumstances and status. The characters are brought to life quite skillfully and their emotions are also quite well portrayed. For the second point, although there aren't many chapters so far and is only generally one chapter per day, the pacing and content is done very well and does leave you expecting more without giving the sense of boredom mid-chapter and skim through them instead. The novel does not feel rushed and the story moves forward in a steady but enjoyable pace. The details are well outlined without beying overly embellished. As for the chapter updates, the speed is quite fine as long as the quality of the content could be maintained or improved. Last not least, while this would lean towards being an 18+ novel, with the quality of the content, it does not feel crassed and vulgar, giving off a more refined and sensual erotic feel that is very enjoyable to read. Basically that's the end of the review. I do highly recommend this for people who enjoy a well written erotic styled novel. And once again to the author, thanks for the pleasant read, and I have very high expectations for the novel and i believe it will definitely do well for it's genre.",981561413

Excellent, even so congrats to the author and translator. My major problem with this book is the huge (and I mean HUUUUUUUUGE) plot holes. Has the author ever read anything about history? How could a Crown Prince marry easily the daughter of a concubine and treat said concubine as his mother-in-law openly? Moreover, the family background is weird and makes no sense at all. One chapter, the author writes this. The next, it is the opposite. Some actions made no sense. The brother is supposed to be very formal with his sister but when he sees her changes he becomes a loving brother after like three lines? The only character who somewhat makes sense is the Emperor. Because yes people, we actually have an Emperor who reacts to ""brave"" girls like an Emperor and not a horny teenager/dog who has never seen a girl. The only downside is that said Emperor somehow can leave the palace whenever he feels like it, with only two people. Lastly, not sure if it's the problem with the translation but what the h*ll is wrong with the title? Transmigrated as the sweetheart of her former uncle?

The fact that the emperor keeps disregarding her views about marrying him is something I don't like and while reading the comments I found it offensive that people were saying things like ""how cute, you can't escape"". Is it bcoz he's handsome and has a good figure, if he were fat, greasy and balding I think the readers would think of it differently and the story would be going in another direction.

If you like stories where women have no say and the ml forces a relationship then this is for you. I usually read transmigration stories to see a woman use her modern intelligence and knowledge to run her own life. And at the very least marry who she wants. This female lead is oblivious to everything including basic personal safety when going out (giving the author many reasons to have her saved by the amazing and super strong but really he is dying emperor everytime. So lame. And of course the invincible emperor gets injured everytime he saves her from something. He fights a horde of wolves effortlessly but get mauled by one that jumped at the female lead. So lame and unrealistic. So. forced marriage. the female lead has no choice people still think its romantic? I like how people think just because the ml is the Emperor and is good looking, his overbearing attitude is just him cutely showing his love. To a 15 old girl on top of it. No means 'it's doesn't matter' in these novels. If he was an ugly obese emperor, people wouldn't be calling this story a romance.

1.8495E+16,4301149120,sinkingship,3,"To start I'd like to say that this novel is translated very well and very consistently, which is a huge plus considering all the other novels on this site which a borderline incomprehensible because of bad translations. Also, the age gap didn't bother me as much as it bothered some other reviewers. MC is a reborn person, so even though the body she is occupying is technically only 15, her mental age is in the mid 20s which is much less weird. Unfortunately, despite being some sort of super doctor, the FL is cast in the role of the weak damsel in distress for the ML to save in pretty much all situations, even when it doesn't make much sense. For example, in an early arc of the story the FL volunteers to go up a dangerous mountain alone to pick herbs for the ML. In her internal monologue, she talks about how she used to roam all over mountains and forests to pick herbs in her previous life, so she knows how to protect herself and there should be no danger ...but then when she actually goes up the mountain, she instantly falls into a hopeless predicament and can only rely on the ML to save her. Like 4 times in a row. And that's just one example. Pretty much every physically dangerous scenario in the book (up to chapter 300 at least) is resolved by the ML arriving on his white horse and ""heroically"" saving the FL so she can blush and swoon. If you're into that style of romance (with one side protecting and the other being protected), then the romance between the two leads in this book is decent enough. The ML also spends a lot of time wooing the FL and his interactions with her in the process are cute and sweet. He is super domineering and possessive, but also at least somewhat respectful of the FL's boundaries. To put it bluntly, at least in the first 300 chapters, he doesn't ever r*pe her - which puts him a step above a lot of other MLs in similar books - but he does do a lot of creepy stuff like coming into her room in the middle of the night and using his position to force her to marry him, even over the objections of both her and her family members.

I love this story and the characters but I might drop it. The love interest is literally 8 years younger than her father and twice her age. I was just going to pretend he was in his early 20’s but they just keep emphasizing his age. Side note: there is absolutely nothing the author can say to make me believe that the ml is a 30 year old man with a harem and he still doesn’t engage in bedroom activities🙄,982511212

2.41299E+16,4322170272,Duke_Asmodeus,5,"Coming to 40 Chapters in and I thought I should do an initial shameless 5 star review before the end of Volume 1. First, thank you to those that have read my novel and those who may read it in the future. It is my pleasure to share my hobby and passion with you all. I believe my novel started off a little better than average, but thanks to the input from readers, it quickly improved for the better. Once the first 10 chapters, my opinion is that the quality only rises. The story is still in the early stages, the enemies and bosses from the games still haven't shown. Lucian had only just set on the path to finding himself (ch.38) and many of the girls' stories haven't even started. I update daily or twice the following day if I am late. The typical upload times are 12:00pm - 4:45pm British time. Once it's contracted, I will consider adding incentives for bonus chapters! This will be a long novel, so I apologise to those that wish for a fast pace and instant story. It will take a while to build up to the moments where he finally confronts the original hero, Lance, or the people who killed both his and Carmilla's parents. I won't rush this to make sure people can see more of their beloved characters and it doesn't end with a single chapter about how he became god and became unfeeling. (Most Cultivation novel endings.) The characters are my beloved creations. Because of the slow pace of my novel, most of them haven't even shown 10% of their true selves. Just like in reality where you can live with a woman for years and she still does things that will shock you. Or leave you stunned. I don't want them to be finished until the very last moment and so you will notice many characters start off jolly and active, yet further on you might find out they were born into an assassin cell or suffer from various ailments.

The girls are not just empty husk although at some point they start feeling similar because of the overwhelming and what not. +The MC character development was pretty good soo far but I'm still confused about some things that happened during it.",981825917

Well, writing quality is good, very good... Author writes like a native English speaker and I had to stalk his profile just to confirm😂 And I get it now how his words flow like that. Was it waddle? I learned a new word today. Character Design, hmm. Well, I find no problem with that, simply because I can remember all the characters due to their unique traits, of course there are monster girls of different flavors😂. MC comes out cowardly at first, which was a turn-off to some degree but later on, starts developing character-wise. Update stability. Just one word. Consistent. World Background. It's a simple fantasy world based off an Eroge(Title of the bk says it all). Kingdoms, Empires, Continents... I am used to CN-kind of topography, so that's why it's simple for me. Story development, hmm, the structure of the story, I don't know... it's just heading toward the right direction. With the power of the MONSTER GIRLS... I initially wanted to drop a 4.8 but since I am in a good mood today I went with 5 stars... I haven't read any Monster girls novels just watched some anime instead like Interspecies Reviewers *Cough* So this will be my first.",981561090

2.26769E+16,4313402998,DaoistKPQJDo,5,Its enjoyable and doesn't leave you annoyed. The ML and FL characters are written well and everything is explained well too. FL transmigrated to the past while the ML was reborn. This combination makes the story exciting and keeps you wondering what will happen in their future. All in all this is a good novel.,981823636
2.26769E+16,4301848565,Anoscetia,4,"WARNING!!! SPILERS AHEAD!!! LOVE IT!!! From the beginning until the end, it was enjoyable. First of all, the story's FL is my favorite in this story as she managed to check every characteristic that I'm looking for an FL. She's strong (emotionally and physically), smart, rational, decisive, proactive, independent but coquettish to the ML, talented, and petty (in a savage way), plus she's also funny and narcistic. The ML is also not bad. He's black-bellied and very supportive of the FL. I can't say much about the ML because there's a lot of ML similar to him. Anyway, he's very good. About the supporting characters, I think the one who should be given the best supporting actor award is the old immortal who never appeared, but his exposure and popularity are the highest aside from the main characters lol. It's really hilarious whenever the old immortal carries all the blame for the FL HAHAHAHAHA. But hey, at least instead of being popular for bombing himself, he became a god-like existence to the masses because of the FL throwing the blame to him. Next is the emperor. You know, it's very rare to encounter a wise and fair emperor in this kind of story. Most of them are fatuous or biased. Or if they can be fair at the beginning, they'll be suspicious at the end or they'll be obsessed with power. But in this story, I'm very satisfied that the emperor was a wise ruler and was not jealous or suspicious of the MCs. Prince Yi, the shameless prince who looked like a banished immortal also made me laugh countless of times. Also, I really like the friendship between the FL and those dandies. From being dandies to being able to realize what they want in life; I feel like an old mother watching my children grow up. And they grew beautifully. Madam Kong and the two children are also very cute. It's undeniable that these three were Shi Qingluo's fans. They type of fan that whatever their idol say was right and their idol can never be wrong lol. As for the little villains, they're annoying but they've been counterattacked by the MCs that their dramas have become a show for the others. Plus, the way how the FL made them speechless and angry to the point of wanting to vomit blood is not only funny but also satisfying. Therefore, even if they are annoying, I'm not that annoyed, instead I am entertained and even laughing whenever they were made traumatized by the FL. But one of my favorites is that this is the ancient times where women's status was far inferior to men. Therefore, I expected that there'll be a lot of negative comments about the FL, so I'm pleasantly surprise that it isn't much, just blurted out by those lemon spirits. Instead, her popularity and reputation are both very good so it's not annoying reading the comments of those passerby, especially when she became famous for being the old immortal's disciple lol. Now, talking about the plot, to be honest, it's the kind where even their daily lives were narrated. It should be boring but it's not, at least for me. It's because even if their daily lives were narrated, it's not that repetitive. Plus, the fact that they are all funny and has the attitude of always wanting to watch a good show. And this kind of narrative even allowed the readers to be even more immerse to the lives of the characters, as such, I feel proud and nostalgic, from Nanxi to Heyang, then from Northern City to the Capital. The changes in their lives were progressive. As for the romance, the FL and ML are more like an old couple whose tacit understanding with each other are very high. They are sweet and supportive of each other, but not the passionate and clingy type. It's stable and fluffy. It's the kind of love that started with mutual respect and support. Also, about the ending, well, either the real ending or the alternative ending, I like them both. I really like that all loose thread were tied up. Their friends' ending, their children's ending, and such. Although I thought that Mo Qingling will be part of their clique, I later realized that he's a background character so it's not that regrettable when his ending was not mentioned. The rebellious second prince was also not mentioned but given that the crown prince successfully ascended to the throne, it's obvious that he failed to claim the throne. Anyway, aside from the not-so important characters which I paid attention to, everyone's ending was mentioned. And although there's no explanation for the FL's interspace, I'll turn a blind eye for that. Some things are meant to be take for granted so that our heads won't hurt to give a valid of explanations for them. And for the translations, I can't say it's good because if you're not paying attention, you'll be confused since the pronouns are mostly mistranslated. But I can't also say that it's bad because aside from the pronouns, almost everything is fine. So, it's 3/5 for the translation. Overall, translation aside, it's a 10/10 for me. I really enjoyed it a lot. I thought 720 chapters is kinda long for this kind of story, but I think it's just fine. It's not boring at all because the characters are funny.",981823825
