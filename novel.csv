“Are you mating with someone?”
Stunned, she took a step back, widening the space between them. “ Excuse me?”
“Ah…” A sigh left his lips. “ Perhaps, I need to rephrase my question. Are you f*cking someone?”
She sucked in a quick breath, not knowing what to say. Anger reared itself in her head, mixing with unexpected desire. Sadly, desire was winning.
He lifted an eyebrow, and in the next instant, he was already standing in front of her body. Her instincts kicked in. She took a couple steps back until her back hit the wall.
The smell of chocolates and almonds rolled between them. Entranced, she thought she smelled the sweetness of the wine but it disappeared as quickly as it came.
“I don’t think that is any of your business, Mr. Graydon.” she made a sound of annoyance.
“Is it not?” His breath fractured, his eyes darkened with desire.
“No.” Her lips quivered at her obvious denial. She mustered all the courage she could, hoping he wouldn’t smell her arousal. She knew it was for naught.
His fingers lightly brushed her cheeks, then they trailed down her neck, lingering on her collarbone, the contact sent shivers down her spine. It awakened the primal need she had been wanting to hide since they met.
She wanted him.
No.
She needed him, inside her.
Her face flushed at the thought of him taking her, preferably right against these walls.
“You want me,” he stated. ““As much as I want you.”
Shocked by her own raw and potent yearning, she turned her head away.
“I don’t…”
“Shhh…” he silenced her with a finger. Then he inched closer, so close his long lashes brushed against her cheek. Her heart pounded like a drum against her chest, fast and hot in anticipation.
“Now tell me little one… do I need to get rid of someone before I make you beg me to let you come?”

Is love worth the chaos it brings?

23583893605477005,Hellbound Heart,Fantasy,KazzenlX,"[WARNING: MATURE CONTENT] - [MAIN STORY IS COMPLETED] Izabelle had underestimated the fire she thought she was going to play with tonight. But how could she ever have foreseen that the man she had happened to come across with does not play with just a small fire, but a whole inferno?
___
Excerpt:
""You going through this marriage with me might as well be like you digging your own grave. Because the moment you start to want more from me, I will divorce you. And the moment you break your promise and try to fight me… I will ruin you and break you apart completely. Mercilessly. You will regret ever meeting this devil tonight."" His threat was given in the same soft but cold voice.

But Elle did not even flinch. Her gaze never faltered either. This man was ruthless, and she knew that clearly. His eyes that moment promised nightmares and darkness without any promise of respite.
But no matter what he says now, it would still not change her decision. She truly had no other choice.

""I understand now…"" she said quietly, steeling herself. ""Since you don't trust that I will keep my word, how about we do this? You prepare the divorce documents beforehand now and I'll sign it. That way, once you decide to divorce me in the future, the papers would already have been signed and there would be no way I can trouble you about it. You would just need to send it to the lawyers and have it notarized.""

A heavy silence reigned before his quiet disbelieving laugh broke the silence.

""I'm at a loss for words, Princess Izabelle."" He looked wickedly amused. But then he started nodding in approval. ""Fine, princess. I will marry you.""

A basketball and sports anime fan died due to malfunction/bug in the system made by GOD which managed the life and death of the people in the multiverse.

GOD apologetic about his death gave him a chance to be reborn in a world of his choice with a few wishes. See the journey of the guy who chooses to be reborn in the world of Kuroko No Basket/Basuke.

Your usual reincarnation with wishes trope but I will try to make it as enjoyable as my measly creativity can make it to be.

The name of many OCs will be taken from different sports anime and there personalities and appearance too might match so be at a lookout for them.

22604318506631405,Saving the Villain,Urban,BAJJ,"The Devil’s Den was Cosette’s favorite webnovel that she had followed for three whole years. She waited for updates, wallow in those empty days during the author’s constant hiatuses, cry and laugh with the characters; it was already a part of her short life.

Cosette really wished that the novel would never end despite that she was terminally ill.

But after three years, The Devil’s Den finally came to an end. With a reader as invested as Cosette, she had mixed emotions about the ending. Not that the ending was disappointing, but what disheartened her was the ending of her favorite character; the villain Maxen Devilsin.

One year later, Cosette took her last breath only to wake up in the body of the stunning Cosette Blac; the villainess of the novel The Devil’s Den, her second favorite character after the villain.

Granted with the opportunity to live in the world of her favorite novel before the main story starts, Cosette had a plan.

That was to simp over the characters and save her favorite characters whilst hoping that the female and male lead still have their happy ending.

In a world that was already written and events that were expected to happen whether or not they wanted to, can Cosette change the course of their lives? Was overwriting the characters' fate could save them? Or would it just give them a much worse ending than what the author had given them?

Watch Cosette as she tried to become the superfan and give the dark-themed story some light.

________________________________

Lucifer Azarel was the son of humanity's strongest Awakened humans, in a world where people awakened various powers.


After his parents perished for the sake of humanity, he was sent to the government facility so that they could keep an eye on his powers when they awakened. Unfortunately, even after 5 years, his powers didn't awaken.

The government gave up on the boy and allowed the scientists to use him as an experimental subject for their painful tests on the human bodies, but on the first test itself, Lucifer died. He saw the smile on the scientist's face even as he took his last breath.

Was it truly the end?

But what happens when the boy truly awakens? What if he awakened not one, but more than four powers that were capable of destroying the world itself if used properly?

The strongest Warlock who could have been humankind's greatest protector was driven to become it's biggest enemy.


What happens when the boy that has awakened several powers at once starts seeking vengeance.

Can the protectors of humanity face the wrath of the Strongest Warlock? Can they stop the person who kills without blinking? Or are they destined to be swallowed by the Darkness they created?

Join the journey of the Most Powerful Warlock...

Rosina, a woman haunted by a dark past, developed a dangerous obsession that led to a trail of blood and corpses. A predator that liked to enjoy her prey before taking their lives.

She has always despised the idea of having a mate until she was compelled to attend the annual mating season. Harboring a deep desire for freedom, she detested any association with royalty.

During the mating event, she encountered a mysterious man wearing a blood-red mask.

Draco was portrayed as a carefree Third Prince who sought only amusement and avoided the responsibilities that came with the crown.

However, his encounter with Rosina ignited a change within him. He realizes that in order to win her hand in marriage, he must become a King.

That transformation set Draco on a path of self-discovery and growth as he strived to prove himself worthy of Rosina's love.

Would their encounter change their fate or push them to ruin?

Volume 2:

""My duty is to find a nobleman to lead my Pack, but you conquered my heart, commoner.""

Felissa was responsible for searching for a mate worthy of status and fulfilling her duty as the only daughter of an Alpha, which led her to revolve her life to become a perfect future Luna of the Midnight pack.

She was known as gentle as a fragile flower, or so they thought. Behind her cheerful smile hid the darkness that wanted to ascend and take over her body. A personality born due to the use of magic.

As Felissa hunted for a noble mate to satisfy her parents. She met a commoner with two identities.

Vicenzo was a man living different lives to keep his mother safe from the abusive Pack. He was willing to sacrifice the mate bond to destroy the New Monarch as his task, but his heart slowly broke apart and yearned for his mate's touch.

Would they prioritize their duty or give in to what their body desired?""

_____

Volume 3:

""I will accept you despite everything you have done, my dearest.""

Gastone lived in the human world as his punishment but was called back to the Werewolf realm by Rosina to find his mate. He didn't want one because of his living situation and pride as a fallen Prince.

Along the way, he saved a troubled woman named Lucia and brought her to the realm after begging him to save her.

That caused problems since Werewolves were myths to humans. With the help of Draco, Gastone and Lucia settled in a secluded place temporarily for security.

Lucia had escaped from the Orphanage that worked in the black market. She aimed to stop its business to save many girl's lives but failed after years of planning.

After meeting Gastone, she intended to use him to her advantage since she needed milk to survive the curse.

Would their love blossom after finding great differences between their races?

IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO NEW READERS! PLEASE READ!

My first few chapters' writing quality is very bad and lackluster but gets much better as the novel progresses!

Also, the first 5 chaps are kinda similar to vamp system but the story and settings differentiate after that into their own thing past that point! Hope you stick around! :)

Quick note! many people in the world are cruel and almost psychotic but there is a good narrative reason for that, it will be explained later on in the novel I promise! :D

21092118006417205,The Villainess with a Heroine Harem,Fantasy,DustyDream,"*Character illustrations in the auxiliary chapter.*

Born and raised as a nameless shadow guard for his kingdom’s crown prince, his life’s purpose was to be used and discarded at the whims of his liege.

And his meaningless life ended when the gaze of a princess lingered on him for too long. The crown prince had him beheaded without a second thought, as if throwing out trash.

Transmigrating into the body of a baby girl, the nameless shadow finally had a name, a family, and a place to call her own. Throwing away his past, the shadow guard was now called ‘Emilia’, and walked on a new path to seek fulfillment.

It was not meant to be, however, as the girl whom she had loved with all her heart and soul ended up mercilessly plunging a dagger through Emilia's love-struck heart at the highest point in her life.

The crowd clamored at the ‘deserved death of the villainess’, and at that moment, the shadow could only wonder… why?

Why am I always the one to dedicate myself fully to someone, only to be thrown away like trash in the end?

And thus, as her soul floated away while cursing in resentment, ‘Emilia’ vowed to herself that in her next life she shall never be the one to fully dedicate herself.

Whatever she likes shall be held in her palm, and shall never escape!

The moment the vow was made, a self-proclaimed villainess system proposed to partner with her, to explore and conquer the worlds through their anchors—the heroes and heroines.

And by cultivating this energy, she shall one day go back. Back to the world she was born as ‘Emilia’ in, and face the so-called heroine once more.

The second time they meet, Emilia won’t be the one drowning in regret!

24912796206512105,Dragon Lord: Erotic MMO,Fantasy,Duke_Asmodeus,"In the year 2173, the world's first Full-World Virtual MMORPG game 'Astral Online' changed the face of the blue planet Asteria. With its revolutionary Digital Capture System, players could scan themselves into the game with up to 20% beautification, and millions flocked to play it.

The game's popularity skyrocketed with the introduction of the Real Money Trading (RMT) system, and professional players formed guilds and factions to increase their profits.

But this prosperity was short-lived, as players began to fuse with their avatars, gaining powerful abilities in the real world that tipped the balance of power and caused chaos.

Two years later, demons and monsters from inside the game invaded the real world, decimating over 90% of humanity.

The remaining survivors were left hiding in fear, unable to fight back against the invaders.

Zell was an average player who spent most of his life working overtime to make ends meet; although he inherited a wonderful house thanks to his parents, most of his wages went to the property tax and food bill.

He found solace in collecting beasts in the game and evolving them into humanoids, primarily females.

When the end came, he was powerless and alone, with only his pets and Rika, his cherished Flame Rabbit, as his companions.

In a final act of bravery, Zell saves the life of a strange girl with white wings, sacrificing himself.

But instead of dying, he awoke in an empty white room with a single computer and a game-like screen that allowed him to edit his IRL avatar and persona.

Zell's second chance at life came with a mission: survive. But who gave him this second chance, and for what reason? Could he meet Rika again, or was she lost forever?

As Zell navigates this dark new world, he must confront the harsh realities of survival, facing danger at every turn and making difficult choices to determine his fate.",296.0,3200000.0,33,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/24912796206512105?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1693622702589

Like every pitiful protagonist, Xueyue's life was riddled with unfortunate events.


An aloof birth mother? Check.
A crazy father? Check.
An older sister with a superior complex?Double-check!


Through a twist of unfortunate events, Xueyue was sentenced to death by beating. And no, she did not reincarnate to a better life.

Offered the opportunity to have a new identity, Xueyue eventually found herself colliding paths with a mischievous and fearsome, but devilishly handsome Commander who'd stop at nothing to acquire her heart.

Will he succeed in doing so?

Sly. Vicious. Ruthless. The very whisper of his name was enough for soldiers to abandon their weapon and armor in the battlefield. Yet, this merciless Commander found himself on wits-end with a sharp-tongued woman that turned his entire world into beautiful chaos.


Many say love is a fleeting emotion, but to them, love is a constant devotion.

21389064705112305,CEO's Runaway Mate and Her Cubs,Urban,xiaohai_23,"It's hard to win when your competition is small, cute, and calls your (future) wife their mommy.

Lara spent six years doing odd jobs to sustain her five-year-old kids. She fled from her birth town after noticing some of her children's weird habits.
They growl when they fight, and their teeth can cut the skin like it's nothing. They prefer meat when it's cooked raw. They howl at the moon when they don't want to sleep.
However, they're her children.
She's been on the run ever since to protect them. She knows nothing about the stranger she met that day and whom she spent the night with. Even the details are blurry in her mind, except for that weird, compelling attraction that brought them together.
When she scores an interview at the most prestigious company in Norwich City, she thinks her life will turn for the better. Until she meets him again.

Nathaniel Woods, Alpha Nate, is the CEO of LY Corp. A fated night of six years ago, he found his true mate. Unfortunately, that woman fled after their passionate night, leaving no traces for him to follow.
A twist of fate makes them meet again, and he's settled on not letting her escape.
But this time, she's not alone. There are two pups with her, growling and fighting, firmly set on not letting him get to their mommy.

WARNINGS:
Possessive male lead and even more possessive little buns.
Slight misunderstandings, not too annoying (hopefully). The male lead is doting, but life is difficult with two jealous pups preventing him from wooing his (future) wife.
The story follows other characters along with the leads.
Smut content (signaled at the beginning with a warning).

Werewolves are a little different from usual, so please bear with my version of the trope ;)

If you can't stand too much cuteness, do not open this book.
If you're allergic to dog fur, stay further away. Characters here are wolves, but some of them grow ears and tail when they're excited (or claws when they feel threatened).

This book is dedicated to all the parents single-handedly raising their cubs

Gu Xi transmigrated to a fantasy world where strength was exalted. He was weak from a young age and was detested by his own clan.
Thankfully, he was bound to the Infinite Extraction System.
With the system, he could analyze anything and discover its weaknesses. He could also extract their impurities and repair their flaws.
Therefore, he extracted the billions of toxins from his own body and tempered a unique Unsullied Body, which put him in the best physical condition for cultivation.
His abilities improved by leaps and bounds.

19246142306924705,Falling in Love with the King of Beasts,Fantasy,AimeeLynn,"[COMPLETE] Reth stalked towards her, chin low so the shadow cast by his hard jaw cut across the thick fur collar of his vest. His hair had fallen over his eyes in the scuffle, so he peered at her through it like a lion in the grass. With each step, his graceful, rolling gait reminded her of a predator stalking its prey. Despite the forest floor littered in twigs and leaves, he didn’t make a sound.

“Wh-who are you?” Elia stammered, backing away, her hands up. He met her step for step until she came up hard against the tree behind her—and didn’t stop until he loomed over her, so broad his shoulders and chest made a wall in front of her. She could feel the heat rising off his skin in the cool, night air.

“I am the Leonine King.” His voice was a dark, husky gravel. Behind him a chorus of wheezes, howls, and chirps of agreement rose from the people watching. “And you are?”

“Elia,” she breathed.

“Elia,” he growled, leaning in closer, bringing with him the scent of pine and rain and the musk of something distinctly male. “I am Reth.” He said the name with a strange, guttural roll in his throat. “I am the King of Beasts. I am Clan Leader, and I am Alpha of WildWood.” Several snarls rose from the crowds behind him then, but he ignored them.

Elia swallowed as he leaned in until the scruff on his jaw rasped her cheek. “I am the King,” he said, “And you will be my mate.”

The forest behind him erupted.

******

Elia is a poor university student until the night she's taken to the world of the Anima—ruled by humans whose ancient hearts pulse with the blood of animals. There she's forced into a battle to the death. But when Elia survives, and refuses to kill her final opponent, the King must either kill Elia himself, or take her as his mate.

Reth, the brutal King of the Beasts with the blood of lions, shocks everyone when he chooses the weak, human Elia to become his Queen. He promises her every comfort of his wealth and position—but he is clear: She will not warm his bed. He chose her to defeat those that were trying to corner him into blending his Leonine line with the Wolves.

Elia needs the help of the Anima to become stronger and rule them well. But the vengeful Wolves see only a weak human that brought them shame. As Elia and Reth grow closer, the wolves are determined to destroy her. Will Reth and Elia admit their feelings for each in time to fight for the Kingdom—and their lives—against the villainous wolf-tribe? Or will the wolves kill Elia and steal the throne?

18131953005387705,Earth's Greatest Magus,Fantasy,Avan,"#Top 20 Webnovel Trending for three years

History is said to be written by the victors. If so, how about the history of Earth, where we are living now?

Two millennia ago, a young boy named Emery met a tragic fate. In his final moments, he was transmigrated and accepted into the most prestigious school of magic in the Universe.

“You are among the chosen few from thousands of human worlds. Whether you seize this opportunity or not, is up to you. You are at Magus Academy, the pinnacle of humanity's ingenuity. Magic, science, and might are all within reach for those who dare to pursue them.""

[Scan complete - Quadruple affinity. Water, Earth, Plant, and Darkness.]

""A quadruple acolyte! Only one in tens of thousands of acolytes possess this!""

Thus began Emery’s journey together with his 4 friends from the furthest corner of Earth.

Each year they returned to Earth to grow, seek revenge, save the princess, conquer the world, and become Earth's Greatest Magus.

Their names are still etched in our history books to this day.

Authors Note:

I have always been fascinated by writing fantasy relating to historical facts. In this story, you will find characters inspired by real-world myth and legend. The universe I created hopefully will make the reader's imagination excited and logically plausible. I hope you enjoy it.

Author's Review After Writing 2000 Chapters

This story is a slow burn, perhaps as slow as the entirety of Volume 1. The main character is still a young boy and makes mistakes along the way. However, if you can push through to the second volume, you'll discover how this narrative managed to stay in the top 20 trending web novels for three years.

Here are some key aspects you'll encounter:

MC: The protagonist follows the classic weak-to-strong arc. Fortunately, he's supported by many loyal friends who help compensate for his weaknesses.

World: Picture a blend of Harry Potter and Star Wars.

System: While it's primarily a magic-based story, there's a structured system in place that's easy to follow. Additionally, elements of cultivation.

Harem: No, there are many female characters. But I enjoy romance first. So even if there will be more than one love interest it will be deep.

Note: English is not my first language, but you'll notice that my writing and English skills gradually improve throughout the chapters.

Other: The novel delves into deep research on science and history, enriching the storyline with factual and intriguing details. Give it a try—you might be pleasantly surprised by what unfolds.",2128.0,10500000.0,"1,789",https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/18131953005387705?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1715270744403

Life didn’t feel worth living on the small blue planet he was born on.
However, it was a seemingly ordinary night on new year’s eve that everything changed!

A raging storm manifested on the mountainside he had climbed on to feel free, to escape the ordinary world that bored him to death.
And death was what awaited him eagerly as he was flung through the air, just to be pricked by an old, seemingly ancient tree trunk.
Not even a miracle would be enough to save him anymore.
But it was just at this moment that something much bigger than a miracle happened.
Every single existence on the blue planet got connected to the Log of the Ancient, something most would label as “Status”.

The ordinary and mundane world changed forever, turning into a bloody and merciless battlefield as the Primordial Ascension unsealed the shackles that weighed on the planet for millions of years.

Mythical mana was unleashed, animals began to mutate, zombies emerged, and monsters known from fairy tales appeared out of Gates.

Follow the journey of a man, who seeks adrenaline, who embraces pain, who overcomes death itself …a man, who will become an Undying existence!

She was a daughter of the general’s family and a gentle woman. She fell for Prince Ding and offered to be his wife. After supporting him for six years, she became his empress.
After risking being a hostage in a foreign country, she returned five years later to find that she no longer had a place in his imperial harem. Lying in his arms, the new consort said with a sneer, “Sis, now that the country is stable, it’s time for you to die.”
Her daughter died a tragic death and her son was removed as crown prince. The Shen family had been loyal, but they ended up being slaughtered.
Shen Miao never thought that their marriage and mutual support all this while would end up being just an act Prince Ding put on! Prince Ding said, “On account that you’ve been with me for twenty years, I’ll allow you to die with your entire body intact. Now you may thank me and hang yourself to death.”
Before she hung herself, Shen Miao made a resentful oath, “When I perish, I will haunt you day and night!”
She was reborn as her fourteen year old self when the tragedies had yet to occur and her family was still intact. She was still the delicate and elegant daughter of a general’s family.
Her relatives were evil, her cousin sisters were vicious and ruthless, and her aunties were eyeing her possessions. She had to protect her family, take revenge, and get back what belonged to her. In this life, she would be the last one standing!
However, the Xie family’s young marquis, an unruly youth, pushed her up against the wall and said arrogantly, “Remember, the world belongs to you, and you belong to me!”
The thirteen cities of You State… belong to you.
The city of Dingyuan in Mobei… belongs to you.
Yuzhou by the Yangtze River, the East Sea of Dingxi, the Green Lake of Lin’an, and Luoyang City… they all belong to you.
If they all belong to me, what will you take, Xie Jingxing?
Hmm… you.
At first, he said impassively, “There has always been a clear distinction between the Shen and Xie family. For the Shen family’s daughter to suddenly show us goodwill, she must have ill intentions!”
Then, he said calmly, “We're all on the same boat. Shen Miao, behave yourself. Who would have the audacity to force you into a marriage while I’m around?”
After that, he said proudly, “Overthrowing an empire isn’t that hard. My dear, how shall we divide this great piece of land?”
Finally, he waved his hand domineeringly. “Sweetheart, dividing them is too much work. Forget it! They’re all yours, and you are mine!”

The real young lady, Ye Ting, was supposedly in Chu Ning’s original poor family, and was forced to drop out of school to work and raise Chu Ning’s seven brothers. In the original story, once the real young lady was reclaimed by the Ye family, the fake young lady’s life fell apart. She started going against the real young lady without knowing that the real young lady was the female lead. The latter even had seven brothers to support her, and she eventually made a comeback with her overwhelming advantage. Meanwhile, the fake young lady had resorted to every scheme she could, even faking suicide, only to end up tragically with everyone hating on her.

Outside the door, her foster mother spoke in an icy tone, “I don’t care. She has to return to the slums. I get annoyed whenever I look at her now. Why does she get to live a lavish life while my biological daughter had to suffer in the slums?

Now that she’s threatening suicide, let’s just let her stay.” Chu Ning rushed out of the ward. “I’ll leave! I’ll discharge today and go back at once.

His deadbeat father had indirectly banished him from the empire.

“Brad...oh, fuck... deeper... harder!” Ada’s shrill voice begged between breathy moans.

The banging of the headboard against the wall intensified as Ann froze.

No... it couldn’t be!

Ann took a deep breath and nudged the door a little more. Her chest felt like it would explode as she held her breath whilst the crack widened.

When it revealed her sister lying underneath her husband-to-be, her hands flew to her mouth to stifle the gasp of horror as her heart shattered instantly.

As Brad roared his release inside her sister, Ada turned her head towards the door with a smirk.

An icy chill descended over Ann as if a bucket of ice water had been thrown over her and she stood and stared, her eyes wide and mouth slightly open in disbelief.

Current Arc: Water 7
.
Extended Summary:
All I know is this is just wrong. I was just reading the latest chapter of One Piece in my computer. And an annoying survey popped up asking me if I want to play One Piece new beginning. Thinking nothing of it I said yes.
And selected 'Realistic' difficulty.
There was a game loading screen. Loading gibberish, and warning me that the world has a lot of surprises in store for me. Not all things are same, because I had to choose the 'developer's time-line'.
And then telling me to brace for Character Synchronization. And before I knew it, I was no longer your average Joe. And this wasn't earth either... no this was One Piece.
And, I was Monkey D. Luffy. The future King of pirates.
I mean what could go wrong? If Luffy could do it, so could I.
But this wasn't the same One piece world I remember. Some changes are small like Kuina being Zoro's rival… who's alive.
While others were huge. Like... did you know, Whitebeard had an actual beard?! Man looked like Santa Claus on steroids. Jaked and shit!
Just what did I get myself into?
But does it matter?
No.
Because I'm going to have the time of my life. This was going to be one heck of an adventure.
.
A/N: Don't worry most of the changes are relatively small and even though it's a slight AU. I won't change the world much. Hopefully...

This story is also in Scrib-bleHub and Fanfiction by me.

1. This is a slow burn for FL and ML
2. Trigger warnings all around. Abuse, trauma, gaslighting and manipulation. These themes are present all throughout the book in different ways.
3. This book is not just about the FL and ML, the cast of characters and side characters are full of rich backstories and their own chapters that play into the central plot of the story.
4. FL is young, she is flawed and she WILL piss you off. We all need time and experience to grow up.

UPDATE December 2, 2021:
I have provided a summary for Chapters 1 - 37 as I'm starting to rewrite them. It can be found in the Auxiliary Volume. Please give this novel another chance. I want to redeem myself as an author.

UPDATE January 19, 2022:
I already wrote the sequel for this novel called, ""Lewd Cultivation System"". The connection will be mentioned in the future, but for now, the connection isn't obvious. It can be read without prior knowledge about Combat Maid Harem.

UPDATE February 11, 2022:
For reasons I do not know, this book got nominated for WSA 2021, which is a huge success for this book. Basically, it means that this book is good enough but not good enough to get the gold, silver, or bronze places.

UPDATE October 3, 2023:
I've decided to pause this novel. I will end it when I have the time. For now, I'll go resume ""Lewd Cultivation System""

* The story will definitely deviate from the original plot and events mainly due to the Butterfly Effect.

* More fleshed-out, complete, logical, and realistic (dark) version of the Naruto world.

* Will include some elements from Naruto's light novels, manga, anime fillers, movies, and data books mixed together so as to create the most logical, real-like world in the end.

* Might not include some Boruto explanations, excessive cosmic, Godly elements, or technological stuff and a few characters. So, a bit AU. I will decide what to include and what not at my own discretion and preferences. So, don't complain.

My native language is not English, and I am not ashamed to say that I am using the so-called ""Best Translator in the World"" to help me with this work (DeepL translator).

I was really trying to find fanfics that take place in the worlds of Baki, Kengan Ashura or the like, and although I found them, I only came across ones where the character gets supernatural powers that put him above any fighter from these worlds, and that frustrated me. A man needs to see two people fighting using their fists entirely, rather than creating interdimensional portals or something of that sort.

So don't expect these kinds of powers here, because here there will just be the old way of solving problems.

For one, there were unusual circumstances surrounding her birth, for another, she is the only pack member to never shift into a wolf form. So now she doesn't quite belong anywhere. Not quite human and not quite wolf.

She thought she would be able to live her life how she wanted when she had turned eighteen. Go to college, make some friends, have some fun. But what is she to do when the dangerously sexy Alpha literally falls right into her lap?

""I am not human, and I am not a wolf. I don't belong anywhere...""
""...we both know that no one is going to mate with me, and even if they did, they would just reject me anyway.""

What is the sexy, brooding Alpha going to do? The elders are making him hold these ridiculous parties to search for a mate. He doesn't want a mate, but he knows he needs a mate to finish the Alpha Circle. Without a mate, a Luna for the pack, his people would suffer. And what is he going to do when he stumbles across the girl that fate has chosen for him and he finds out she has no wolf?

""This cannot be!"" I roared. ""There is no way that I can mate with a girl that does not even have a wolf. She will be too weak. She will be inferior. She will not be strong enough to be a Luna.""
""I simply could not accept her as my mate. Not fully. It wasn't safe for her. She would get herself killed. And she would bring my pack down with her.""

When these two meet, sparks will surely fly. But will it be from passion, or their constant fighting? Neither of them wanted a mate. Neither of them wants the mate that fate chose for them. And neither of them can make that mate bond go away. What are they going to do now that they're literally stuck with each other?

This story is my first wish fulfillment. It will be a little different from Genshin Impact's story, since the game is updated so often and things are added or changed. Currently it's patch 2.3 and I have been playing the game since it came out. So I am following the story closely, but...

It will not always be the same story. I'll do my best to get as close to the original as possible with my writing skills.

I will primarily focus on adding new things as well.

The romance will be slow, but we will get there.

Smut is out around chapters 120, mostly to develop romance before going into it.

Harem will be expanding, but at a decent rate...

I want to develop the characters first before I undergo another harem expansion.",245.0,3426603.0,21,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/19493733706605405?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1679968560429

Elise had about to change into the dress that was lying on the corner of her bed when she heard a knock lightly calling from her door. Curious, she turned the door knob only to have a tall man towering in front of her.

“Master Ian!” She called.

Ian smiled with the usual mischievous smirk that he always used. His crimson eyes trailing a little over her room and spotted the black dress over her bed and shifted his eyes over to the woman in front of him. He stepped forward and spoke. “Where did you acquire that dress?”

“Mr. Harland gave it to me.” Elise replied and strained her neck to see Ian’s brows knitted in its elegance.

“Do you know why a man would love to give a woman a dress?” He gave the riddle that she always had to think twice before replying. But this time, she found no answer and instead shook her head. “I don’t know.”

His grin grew bewitching as though something had stirred deep inside the scarlet eyes that he had. He slowly slid his hand over the collar of her dress, sending a cold shiver that startled her for a moment due to its freezing temperature. After unbuttoning the first two buttons on her collar, he tilted his head down, whispering to her ears. “Because they want to be the one to undress the cloth.”

He paused and kissed her neck, turning the pale skin to red before retracting his move to fix his eyes on her and leisurely replied. “Unfortunately, you can’t wear the dress over there with this.” He chuckled and passed a box over to her hand. “And the fortunate news is I prepared a dress for you.”



Elise was a cursed little girl who could see ghosts. Her family hated her and threw her from one adoptive family to another. However, misfortune didn't act alone. When she was brought up by her aunt, she was sold as a slave. When she had thought she would become nothing but a sacrifice to the sorcerer, she was saved by a man whose identity was far different than a normal mythical being.

What to expect;

Strong Romance; MC is romantic type of a guy that abhors to use women. There will be many women around him but he will woo them with love.

Harem(Incest); There will be many women from the anime and some OCs. Momo and their mother will also be part of the harem.

Slow Pace; It is not going to be meeting and fucking in an instant. I like to take my time and build up the romance before getting into the action so if you are looking for quick fucks, this story is not for you.

Strong but not Overpowered MC; He is always stronger than average but not omnipotent. Expect him to fallback and lose things just to rise on his feet stronger. Although the main theme is not power, the novel has some.

Some dark truths about world that may trigger you. Abuse of minors and worse. Never done by MC, will never be done MC but as MC discovers more about the Dark Organization, the nastier it will get. If you are a snowflake, I don't recommend you to read.

""With Zombies appear everywhere, I need an infinite strength... this is one, I still need to choose 2 Talents more...""

Then a lewd smile formed on his lips.

""I want an infinite strength, charm and charisma to conquer women, and the last one, I want to upgrade my **** so I can please my women!""

""Hahaha, there's no way such talent exists... ehhhhh?!!!""

i will admit that during that time, I am still a young budding author and could have expressed the story better in the early hundred chapters. But I assure you the story development is worth it.

15595983206141505,The CEO's Wife Is A Demon God's Daughter,Fantasy,ellezar_g,"[ Book 1: Completed ]
Tristan Davis, the playboy CEO of the Heavenly Star Enterprize, was forced to marry ANY WOMAN within one month, or else... his glamorous title and position will be stripped off of him.

NOOOOO!

How could he seduce those beautiful women if he became poor and no longer a CEO?

Alright, he will find a woman and marry her to please his demanding grandfather. Who cares if it's a weird strange woman he met on the mountain while going camping. Right?

Wait.. What!? She is NOT HUMAN? She is the demon god's daughter?

Did you say... DEMON?

But she looks so angelic, beautiful and innocent. Tristan couldn't even look at any other women after this demon god's daughter becomes his wife.

Ha. He might as well keep her around since grandpa seems to like her so much.
============
Zhen-Zhen, who had the bloodline of the demon god, was being targeted by the guardian warriors. Ever since she was a child they tried to kill her many times but failed. With no other choice left, they sealed her in the Divine Mountain.

But after 100 years, her seal was accidentally broken and so, her Protector found the chance to send her to another world inhabited by purely ordinary humans- no supernatural beings, and no magical powers.

In this new world, she met the Naughty Handsome CEO, who proposed a marriage to her on their first meeting.

But wait... Marriage? Becoming his Wife? What does it mean to become a Wife?

Though the demon god's daughter was clueless about what is meant of becoming a wife, she excitedly accepted his proposal!

""Yes! I want to be your wife!""
============
*** Excerpt ***
Zhen-Zhen: ""Tristan, why are you laughing even though you are sad? I can feel it. You are in pain, right now.""

In his drunken state, Tristan could still absorb her words.

Tristan: ""Hey, my Zhen-Zhen. You will be my wife, right?""
Zhen-Zhen: ""Yes…""
Tristan: ""Then... make me happy. Come closer… and kiss me.""

She leaned closer to Tristan as she pressed her delicate warm lips into his cold lips.

Zhen-Zhen: ""Are you happy now, Tristan?""

Tristan shook his head and pouted.

""No! Zhen-Zhen, that one could not be considered as a kiss! You just pressed your lips into mine."" He complained to her exasperatedly.
“Come here, I’ll teach you!” Tristan held her face then he began to kiss her passionately.

Tristan pulled her head closer as he deepened the kiss. After a few seconds, Zhen-Zhen responded and returned his kiss with equal intensity as his.
'Damn, she's a fast learner.'

A boy devastated by the loss of his family turned to games to fill the void.

The game he chose was a Virtual Reality Role Playing Game where you could seduce and have passionate erotic scene's with the heroines, as it was rated 18+

On his first day before playing the game, he chose to use a preset of a character with a similar name to his, ""Lucian Von Silver,"" a vampire baron but a sub-villain in the game's standard route, only surviving properly.

However, this route would see him lose his beloved childhood friend because of his useless talent and playboy lifestyle.

When choosing this, Lucian thought nothing could go wrong with making a custom avatar that looked like the perfect mix of the two.

When he entered the game, a strange figure appeared above his home, apologising as lightning struck down on his house.

Lucian was electrocuted inside his VR pod and died without starting the game.

Yet this was unknown to Lucian, who awakened in a luxurious nobles' room.

Slightly confused, he decided to keep playing, only to discover he now inhabited the body of the actual baron, ""Lucian Von Silver!""

But this was not the game, but a real world that the game was based on.

He began to feel dread at the thought of the future until he gained the system that would guide him.

Shaman, a normal teenage girl falls asleep on the eve of her 18th birthday like any other night. She awakens to find herself in an unknown place in an unfamiliar body with an unhelpful voice in her head.


On top of that, she has gained fox ears and a tail, she also seems to have memories of this new world and the body she finds herself in. Unfortunately not all of the memories are clear and she must rely on this rpg like system in her head to both unlock these memories and guide her on a path home.


As she explores the world she finds that it is somehow both modern and old, with magic permeating every day life. Architecture reminiscent of the 1700s clashes with modern day conveniences enabled through magic.


Will Shaman be able to make use of her knowledge of video games and novels to take advantage of her rpg system in this new world? Or will she be dragged down and entangled by the darkness of the world around her as she searches for the truth behind her circumstances? Many eyes are upon her as she takes center stage in this new world.

--------------------------------------------------------

Greetings, dear readers! As the author of this book, I would like to take a moment to talk about its structure and pacing.
When I first started writing this story, I was still learning the craft of writing and exploring the world and characters I had created.
As a result, the first volume of this book may feel a little slow-paced at times, as I took my time to introduce the setting, the plot, and the main characters.

However, as I gained more experience and feedback from readers like you, I realized that I could improve the pacing and make the story more engaging and exciting.

Therefore, I have been constantly revising and editing the chapters, trying to find ways to streamline the exposition, increase the tension, and deepen the character development.

You may notice some differences between the original and current versions if you have read the first volume already. Some scenes may have been cut or shortened, while others may have been expanded or rearranged.
However, I want to assure you that the core of the story remains the same and that the characters and themes will continue to evolve and surprise you.

The last issue I would like to address is the portrayal of the main character (MC) on this website. I have noticed that on average, on this website, there are two types of MCs:

1) The ruthless, apathetic, or cold MC
2) The normal or intelligent MC

The problem with both types is that they often become godlike or fighting experts within just five chapters. Not only is this unrealistic, but it can also become monotonous, in my opinion. It seems that many authors tend to use these two types frequently. That is why I have created a completely different main character for my story.

In this story, the MC is flawed and has faced many challenges in life. Unlike other characters who are already ahead, the MC finds himself starting from nothing. He learns to fight, interact with people, and manage difficult situations. This means that he won't always make the same choices or take the same path as you would. It's important to remember that every person would react differently in each situation, and there is no universal answer for how to handle every circumstance. Please keep this in mind when you come across moments where you may not agree with the MC's actions and consider his unique perspective and way of thinking.

The protagonist actually has principles and is not just about a life of sexual adventures. He's about growing incredibly strong through challenges and looking damn good doing it.

But not everything comes naturally to the protagonist. He has to work for it and we will accompany him. That means it will be explained, to a certain extent, what the protagonist is thinking and why he does what he does.

It is a process. Timeskips will not just happen, but they will be witnessed and lived through. Everything that happens during this time will be explained.

There's only one goal in his mind - to be the number one star in the Interstellar era.

With the knowledge and skills he got from his past life, he would definitely achieve it.

A/N: First of all I want to declare that English is not my first language, so if you cannot overlook a few mistakes then this fanfic is not for you.

The MC is neutral evil, so don't complain about that at a later date saying that MC is evil or something like that.

Last warning, in this fanfic some characters will have a different attitude than the canon or the original version so please note this warning before jumping into this.

I am also writing this to pass my time nothing serious, but I will try my best to complete this fic. This is going to be a World Travel Fic.

MC doesn't meet a God after his death so he didn't have an idea about what he had to do in the future or even if he will have a power or not.

22478302906798505,Rebirth of the Nameless Immortal God,Action,Awespec,"Earth has undergone an odd change. Expanding by millions of times its original size, its population was suddenly split into two halves.

On one side, there was a group of technologically advanced humans. But, on the other, a world of cultivation had grown and pospered.

The secrets that led to this change have been hidden in the darkness for too long... Until there came a day where a boy born on the Mortal side of the world was found to have the talent to enter the Martial side. Having lost both of his parents to a hidden tide, he chose to leave all that he had known behind and enter this land of danger.

What truths would he unveil? What would he learn about what separated the Mortals from the Cultivators? What hidden evils wanted to ensure that his people never rose up and gained power? And how would those evils... deal with him?

----

This list of things I hate is quite long.

The first is that I hate to be tested the most.

The second is that I hate to be tested the most.

The third also happens to be that I hate to be tested the most.

The ocean's depths are too shallow, the sun's light too dim, the ground too mundane and the skies too small. For those born of this colorless world to deem themselves worthy of casting judgement on me... I can only say that it's laughable.

I am the Nameless Immortal God because even the Heavens themselves are unworthy to name me. Even while I am unaware of my own identity, I will dry the oceans until cracked land is all that is left, I will cast the sun into endless darkness, I will shatter the ground with my feet and sunder the skies with my blade.

Am I too arrogant? What right do you have to think that?

The Fortis Kingdom has a King who still has a very easy age. However, even though the King is still young, the King has the ability to command, high intelligence, and has a good personality towards others.

When these Kingdoms appear to the world. There are many powers that want to dominate this kingdom especially the World Government as well as some of the great pirates residing in the New World.

Then? How will the story continue?

This story itself is a story that tells of a man who wants to build a comfortable kingdom for him to live in. This man will later be assisted by his friends who will later be summoned by him from various different worlds with a system given to him.

The story itself will progress very slowly. So, for anyone who doesn't want to read a story with a slow plot. Please leave it.

In addition, regarding the issue of considering the harem or not. Still not determined. I haven't decided yet and want to focus more on developing this story.

Final. I'm not good at English. Therefore the English used in this story may be destroyed. I only use google translation to translate my original script which was previously in Indonesian into English. So, there are many words or sentences that are difficult to understand.

I hope you can understand.

Ok. That's enough of my opening.

For those who like my stories please keep them in the library and for those who don't you don't need to read them.

16991282905050905,Rebirth: Ghost Exorciser,Fantasy,Candle Stream,"Chi Shuyan lived miserably in her past life. She obviously has great fortune, but it is ‘borrowed’, and so her great fortune turns into bad luck—a good hand turns rotten. Her family falls apart and dies. Her relatives take possession of her properties. She is reported for cheating during the college entrance exams. Her future is in total ruins.
And she still foolishly feels grateful to her best friend who had orchestrated it all.
Until one day, a Celestial Master spots the deception and takes her as her apprentice.
Chi Shuyan rises from the ashes, becoming a blood-soaked demoness, whose name makes people tremble in fear as she slays all evil people. This ends up ending her own life.
Reborn once more, she returns to when she is 17-year-old with the memories of her previous life before the college entrance exam.
In this life, she is endowed with supernatural powers and can foresee anyone's fate and future with great accuracy.
She vows to trample on all those who caused her family's ruin in her past life.
But before she can exact her revenge…
One day, she touches a business magnate, and sees herself wearing some kind of cat ears sexy outfit coming out of the bathroom before kneeling at the man's suit pants, calling him Daddy!
Chi Shuyan is shocked: How bad is my life going to be in the future? How can it be so indecent!
Qi Zhenbai, the ruler of the powerful and deep-rooted Qi family in the capital, fully deserves being God’s favored one - handsome in appearance, indifferent in character, iron-blooded and strong in means and the second most sought after bachelor in the city. He is a hotshot, except for being so weak and sickly that doctors have determined that he won't live past 30.
His past life ended at 29.
However, this life is fated to be a little different after meeting her.
Making money in summer vacation.
""There are too many crooks these days."" 
“Exactly, they perfectly able, but they don't look for a good job.”
A group of people points at Chi Shuyan, who has set up a fortune telling stall. On the one hand, she is discouraged from pretending to be a swindler, but also encouraged to resemble one slightly. Chi Shuyan stays firm, drawing talismans while sucking on a lollipop. 
One month later…
""Master Chi, fortunately you told my fortune. You allowed me to escape the misfortune.""
""Master Chi, how much is this Ghost Ward Talisman? I want 10 of them!""
""Master Chi, can you help me calculate my family's luck in passing? Money is not a problem.""
People’s eyes glow as they look at Chi Shuyan collecting excessive amounts of money. To look so sage-like even when doing a tacky task of collecting money, she's indeed an erudite expert.",1854.0,4200000.0,48,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/16991282905050905?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1596508835681

This fan fiction assumes that the main group of the MHA manga started attending U.A in the year 2014, the year the manga started serialization. It also makes the assumption that due to Quirks being around for several generations that science isn't completely up to where we are now as Quirks can do what would otherwise required innovation from science to create. In addition, this MC has his powers converted to Quirks and as such they require time and training to improve.

First it seemed that only technology would evolve, but who knew the world itself could too? It wasn’t as simple as climate change or tectonic movement. No, the fundamental laws of physics that governed everything were changing.

Leonel was fairly lucky. His family was decently well off, his father loved him enough to brew vomit inducing nutrient rich smoothies every morning, and this was both the day of the National Championship and his 521st confession to his dream girl, Aina. As his father always said, nothing was more important than respect and persistence.

Unfortunately, everything changed that night. At the after party of ages, the world reached a saturation point and an apocalypse descended.

Abilities awakened. Sub-Dimensional Zones opened. Invalids rampaged through the Earth like a virus...

Those who could evolve would have a slim chance for survival. Those who couldn’t would die.

This novel will be a unique spin on the dungeon/system genre. Dungeons won't be dungeons and the system won't be a system... Take a look to find out what I mean :)

However, he committed a grave blunder by taking the fiction he had read as a reference. Reborn as a baby, he hoped to be deemed gifted by speaking early.

One thing led to another, and tragedy struck. The villagers declared him a demon-possessed and called the church. Johnathan, now known as Sylvester Maximilian, realized that he had messed up.

When the church's inquisitors came to judge him and burn him on a pyre. As a last resort and to welcome his soon to arrive second death, he started chanting holy hymns as his last breath.

Overwhelmed, they kneeled, thinking he was a messenger of Solis.

From there, the story of how Sylvester Maximilian rose through the ranks to sit at the top began.

But his life won't be ordinary, as he uses his cunning and the tag of 'God's favored' to his advantage. Fighting treachery, unearthing secret plots and world mysteries, facing the darkness around him and creating his place in history, engraving his name in the annals to be forever remembered as the—Immortal Pope, The Young.

[A/N: To not mislead you, the novel's name does not mean he instantly becomes the Pope from the start. The story will follow the life of MC. Though he will become the Pope at a pretty young age. 40% of the novel will be based around MC fighting to sit on the supreme throne.

If you enjoy world building and lore building, then you will like this story.]

No he is NOT the real Madara, he will NOT have Madara full powers, and the story is NOT about him becoming the one all be all and dominating all the world and getting all the girls.

24908760405236305,God of Crime: Strongest Mafia Boss,Fantasy,HIKARU_GENJI,"The gods exist. The Supernatural is real.

But poor foolish Mortals can never pierce through the Truth hidden by the Veil.

They say Ignorance is Bliss. But for Adam, such Bliss woven by a lie is worthless.

In his opinion, Ignorance may be Bliss but --- Knowledge is power.

This was the truest fact; something Adam built his empire around.

----

He wasn’t always this rich. He wasn’t always this powerful. There was a time he too struggled to earn enough for the treatment of his sick and dying mother.

But one day, on a Halloween night, his life was forever changed.

His eyes were opened to a completely new Reality.

The truth that was hidden from the eyes of all normal humans.

An entirely different world, rules, and society exist just in front of us.

Follow Adam, as he uncovers the Truth about his identity, the power in his blood, and his adventures as he rises to the throne that is rightfully his.

To attain his goal, he will not hesitate. He will even become the God of Crime if that is necessary.

---------

The story will be moderately slow-paced during the First four volumes as I set Adam in the world and slowly develop the world-building and Adam starts to adapt to the new reality.

I know it might not be to the taste of everyone, but I believe it's worth it.

We discover the world together with Adam and how he will grow from someone who knew absolutely nothing about the supernatural world to being someone no one can ignore.

This will be a long road and I would be happy if you are willing to walk this road with me.

Jiang Yu looked at her mother, who was talking non-stop on the negotiation table. She watched as her mother named her price as she sold Jiang Yu. Jiang Yu could not believe it. Eighteen years ago, they brought the wrong baby home from the hospital, and Jiang Yu, the real daughter of a wealthy family, ended up in an orphanage until a year ago. Jiang Ran, the fake daughter of the Jiang family, grew up with a silver spoon in her mouth. With superior resources since she was young, she was more outstanding than Jiang Yu in every aspect and became the pride of the Jiang family. Jiang Yu, who wandered most of her time in the outside world, was nothing but a country bumpkin who made her mother a laughing stock in the socialite circle. However, Jiang Yu had no idea how great her mother's hatred for her was. On the day she turned eighteen, her mother 'sold' her with a named price. Jiang Yu said, ""If you want to marry your daughter to someone else, it should be Jiang Ran. I'm your real daughter. You're the one who mistakenly brought Jiang Ran home!""

Those were the words prompted in the mysterious screen in front of her as blood kept pouring out of her wounds, for Grayfia Lucifuge, a devil in the middle of the civil war against the Old Satan Faction; there could not be more treacherous yet hope-inducing words, it could be a trap, but it could not.

She had the option to choose between 'Yes' and 'No'.

For her who was at the edge of death with a family that needed support and a cause to fight for, there was not much of a choice.

Little did she know, the mission she was tasked to do wouldn't be a simple or common one.

In the faraway multiverse of Helius, one of the most powerful entities in endless existence slumbered atop his myriad treasures when his senses perceived something that shouldn't be possible. Intruders were common; Intruders remaining in his realm this long without perishing... were extremely rare.

Upon appearing before the silver-haired maiden in odd attire, he huffed a breath frightening enough to make the strongest gods flee on the spot, but she remained in place - conflicted, but in place.

""Before you perish, tell me... what is an ant like you doing in my realm? and why are you still alive?"" Disbelief was concealed in his mighty voice.

The maid thought a lot about what words had to come out of her lips for her to survive this hurdle, eventually, with her century-worth of experience in romance, she managed to find a fitting answer.

""You're the Primordial Golden Dragon God, Richter-sama, right?"" She asked with serenity.

""Sama? I don't know about that... but you're correct. With your foot standing on my treasury realm, do you still dare ask about my identity, Demoness? you haven't-""

On May 28, 2010, the world was forever changed by the third awakening. Suddenly, smaller worlds connected with the main world and beings of different races appeared, each with their own unique powers. The world was thrown into chaos as people tried to understand and control these newfound abilities.

But amidst all the confusion, towering structures began to appear all over the world. These towers held unimaginable power, and those who were already gifted with abilities could upgrade and become even stronger. Even those without powers could gain them through rigorous tests within the towers.

As expected, conflicts erupted across the globe as everyone scrambled to claim these towers for themselves. And at the heart of it, all was Luan Dimas, a man who had lived for a thousand years and had amassed an arsenal of techniques. He was transported back four months before the awakening, and now had the chance to correct his past mistakes.

Luan knew that he couldn't let this opportunity slip away. He had to make the most of this new chance and take control of the towers before anyone else could. But with so many others vying for power, the competition would be fierce, and the battles even more brutal.

With his knowledge and skill, Luan would have to fight his way through the chaos and overcome any obstacles in his path. The fate of the world hung in the balance, and Luan was determined to come out on top, no matter what it took.

It was too late when she realized that the man she asked for help was far more cruel, twisted, and downright diabolical than the crown prince for taking her as his… pet!

EXCERPT:

With a pair of crimson eyes hovering over her, Aries held her breath. When the corner of his lips curled up devilishly, she couldn’t react fast as he swiftly flipped their position. She only realized it when she was saddling him, gazing down at Abel, wide-eyed.

“No one is above me in this empire and even out — not even the law, but look at you,” he intoned with a devilish smirk. “Staring down on me… so daunting.”

Aries bit her lip, planting her palm on her inked chest. “Your Majesty…”

“Do you now understand the power you hold, darling?” Abel carefully wrapped his fingers around her wrist, chuffed by her reaction. “Only you, Aries, may go above me and the only person in this world who can look down on me. No one else.”

He raised an arm and ran his fingers through the side of her hair, settling his palm on the back of her head before he pulled her down until her face was a palm length away from him.

“You better use this at your own disposal,” he whispered, tilting his head as he lifted it up to claim what’s his. HER.

Meet Eustass Silvestri Abel Bloodworth, the sadistic tyrant, who reigned an empire with an iron fist. With his pet, Aries’ increasing presence in his boring, dark life, he was set to kill her. But alas, every time he thought of taking her life, he finds himself changing his mind.

The more he kept her by his side, the more it got harder to dispose of her. And the more he yearned for something deeper and darker... it was driving him insane.

With a secret he was keeping from her, what would Abel do if Aries found out about the rotting truth behind the empire and the emperor? Would he kill her? Or kiss her? Perhaps cage her?

And if she found out that Abel wasn’t just a normal human, would she try to escape? Or would she accept that he wasn’t just a demon incarnate?

In a complicated world that tainted them black, was love even possible to bloom between a pet and her master? Watch as these two play the dangerous and insane game of love and lust.

Who would be the master and the pet? Who was the prey? Read to find out more.

20524563005115705,The Author's POV,Fantasy,Entrail_JI,"The person whom the world revolves around.

The person who defeats all of his opponents, and ultimately gets the beautiful girl.

The sole existence all villains fear.

That is the protagonist.

What about me?

As a failed author who had only one success throughout his whole career, I had reincarnated into my late novel.

""This is it""

I thought, as I tightly clenched my fist.

Did I just get reincarnated in my own novel?

Is this where I reincarnate in a novel and become the protagonist?

No.

Sadly it's not that kind of novel, as I reincarnated as a mob.

The world doesn't revolve around me.

The girls don't come flocking towards me.

The cheat items don't come to me.

""Phew""

I let out a sigh of relief.

""Thank god I'm not the protagonist""

I joyfully shouted as tears streamed down my cheeks.

Wait, are you curious as to why I don't want to be the protagonist?

I did forget to mention the most important thing when I was describing a protagonist.

That is...

They are calamity magnets.

I just died. If I learned something from that, it's that it really isn't a pleasant experience.

If possible let me live a long stable life.

Thank you, whoever reincarnated me.

I would later come to regret these words...

The great Empire of Alfaros was in chaos.
Prince Regan was returning from the battlefield after four years.
Years ago, he used to be the most beautiful prince of the Empire.
Ironically, the same prince was today known as The Masked Prince.
It is said that he had a huge scar on his face, a face that used to be very beautiful.
The scar was so horrifying that the Emperor got scared when he saw it and sent him away to the battlefield.
But the war was over.
And he was to return.
.
.
.
Looking at the green eyes that didn't even flicker at the sight of his scarred face, Regan was filled with a surprise for a moment.

At the same time, something flashed in his cold eyes when he saw how calm she looked.

""What is your name?""

""Evelyn, Your Highness""

""Evelyn...""

Regan tasted the name on his lips.

His red eyes looked at her face which was completely blank and he said

""Evelyn, you will be my personal slave from today on.""

Evelyn looked calm.

However, as time passed, Evelyn realized that Regan wanted more.

Much more than she could give him.

She tried to stop him. But what would she do when the prince forcefully put his heart into her hands and was adamant about taking hers?

Will Evelyn then choose to move away or to move on? Especially at the time when horrors of her past shadow her heart

Because there is no way she will want to break off this marriage. She was a power-hungry and scheming woman who would do anything to gain more influence. There was no way she would willingly give up her position as a member of the Royal Family.

Yang Ning noticed the man's suspicious and disdainful expression, but she remained polite and answered with a smile, ""Your Highness, the reason is simple. I don't want to be a sacrificial lamb.""

She scowled inwardly, wishing she could just break off the engagement and be done with it. ‘What is his problem? Just break the marriage alliance and be done with it. Didn’t you hate me? Now I am giving you a chance; Just call it off!’

The Crown Prince was confused by her cryptic words. Was she trying to manipulate him by her confusing words?

She gave a fake smile, but inside, she was crying. She knew that marrying this man would mean putting her life on the line. Who in their right mind would willingly offer their neck on a silver platter?

Not her!

She refused to be a villain in someone else's story. Instead, she was determined to take control of her own fate.

A normal man, through some bullshit luck, got chosen to reincarnate in another world after getting killed by the legendary Truck-kun.
Distraught at the fact that he died without losing his V-Card, he becomes impatient and wanted to get the reincarnation process over quickly. Because of this, he ended up annoying the ROB overseeing his reincarnation, and to spite him, the ROB rigged his quest system.
Because of this he ended up being forced to keep the timelines of the worlds he travels to intact and as close to canon as possible. If not, the world collapses.
The problem? The bad guys all have power ups while the good guys get nothing.
Follow our resident MC as he tried to keep the timelines intact while doing his best to become relevant and interact with the characters... and maybe get some girls on the way. Maybe.

I'm planning to have harem in the story but I REALLY want to keep it small, like 1-2 people per world, 3 if we're pushing it and it's a harem heavy world (e.g. DXD).

16535906606408905,Death Guns In Another World,Fantasy,Nickaido,"Check out my new novels: Era of Players: Death God

Reset: New World

°°°°°
Alexander Kael Touch, a self-made young billionaire, found his meteoric rise tragically cut short on a school trip. But fate had other plans, whisking him and his classmates away to a realm of swords and magic – a world where power manifested as unique: ''Gifts.""

While friends awoke to magnificent Gifts, Alex's Gift yielded only two enigmatic guns: one gleaming silver, the other shrouded in black.

Worse, he couldn't use magic like his peers, drawing scorn and derision. Yet, fueled by an unyielding spirit and a burning dream, Alex refused to falter.

In this new world, he craved not wealth, but the strength to forge his own destiny. One goal burned bright: to rise once more, not to the peaks of financial power, but to the pinnacle of strength and control.

This is the chronicle of Alexander Kael Touch, the boy with two guns in a world of wonders. A tale of relentless struggle, forged in the crucible of mockery and doubt. A journey to the apex, where the scorned student will become the ultimate warrior.

Whispers of the ""Death Guns Master"" stir, echoes of a legend rising from slumber. The world may have forgotten them, but they are coming back.



††††††††††††

Nickaido's here with D-Guns, do not expect the smartest MC because he was once a billionaire, is still young, he has his flaws, he will learn and grow, so will the other characters. At the beginning other characters are stronger but worry not everything will change starting from around chapter 80 onward. Also sorry in advance because some of the female characters have strong backgrounds but it's for the sake of the future story, this book is just the start, I'm still improving.

Sorry in advance, English is not my first language, so they may be grammatical errors and misspelled words. Please bear with me. I'm trying to improve to provide a better story.

Starting from chapter 200th, I have started using Grammarly premium to help me with the English, so I think it's become better. As for the earliest chapters, I have started to re-edit them slowly; I will do more as I get more time. Maybe hire a professional editor when I can.

Once again, this is not some sophisticated story; it has many flaws, which I'm trying to learn from; however, this doesn't make the story less enjoyable. Would you please give it a try?

Good News: I reincarnated!

Bad News: I reincarnated inside my favorite novel!!!

You are asking me why this is bad news?

That is because...

In this world, even the main cast was going to die halfway through the story!

The only character who won't die no matter what was the protagonist.

And of course, I wasn't the protagonist.

Nor was I the character who had a special background to make you think of him as a hidden protagonist.

A question I’ve asked myself a thousand times, as I read stories or watched animes involving Truck-kun. I’m sure many of you would have the same answer as me: ‘You get reincarnated silly.’

Or even those who’d say: ‘You meet an ROB and get a zillion wishes and go to your favorite world to build a harem and have cock measuring contests with everyone who looks wrong at you, DUH.’

I was surprised when I got to test it first hand. Scratch that, the only thought on my mind as I faced the enormous monstrosity, if there was any, was that I didn’t want to die, while my body thought it would magically solve the solution if I pissed and shat myself. Turns out that men shit themselves when they die, who knew?'

This part is to help you decide if you want to read this or not.

1- Is this a HAREM story?

I understand this is a deal breaker for a lot of people. So I'll avoid wasting your time. I didn't add a HAREM tag because it's not a HAREM story just yet.
However, if you are ABSOLUTELY against the very idea of Harems, I suggest you avoid reading this, because as the author I am open to the possibility.
However, at no point will this become a story where the MC gets any girl he wants just because he looked their way. I wish to make the interactions as human as possible. Needless to say, with the system, it might tip the scale in his favor.

2- Is the MC OP?

At the start? Nope. he is as ordinary as they come. I'm trying to maintain a balance in the story. if he can speed run the world, there is no point in writing about his adventures at all if he's already a god.
he will EVENTUALLY be OP, but not right off the bat.

The crown prince was cursed on the day he was born, that he will never be happy. What's worse, no woman could touch him without dying. Thus, finding a wife to produce an heir became the royal family's greatest challenge since the prince is the only son.

Until one day.. a servant girl who tried to kill him didn't end up dying after they touched. Emmelyn was a princess from one of their colonies who vowed to avenge her family's death by killing the crown prince. And that's how she ended up in his castle.

Seeing that she was the only woman he could have a sexual relationship with, without killing her, the prince made an agreement to let her go and free her kingdom from his oppression if she produced for him three heirs.

Emmelyn said yes, but every day that they were together, she made plans to kill him and get her revenge.

Can Emmelyn get what she wanted, or would she be entangled deeper with the enemy who was deemed as the devil incarnate himself by his enemies?

EXCERPT:
""You will be the mother of my children,"" said the man in a commanding tone. His shameless words rendered Emmelyn speechless and shocked, more so, than the kiss he landed on her lips earlier. ""I need three children from you.""

""Eh ... wait.. what? Hold on a minute,"" Emmelyn, who was moved from her shock, hurriedly rubbed her lips roughly as if trying to remove the devil's marks from them. ""I don't want to be your wife! I don't want to marry you, you devil!!""

The man frowned and squinted his eyes menacingly. ""Who said anything about marriage?""

THE NEXT DAY
""Let's go,"" said the prince.
""Let's go where?"" Emmelyn asked, not understanding.
""Let's go make babies.""

Notes:

Side Stories in ""My Cute (Yandere) Disciples' Side Stories""

If you're here for the R18 tag expecting adult scenes, know that this was a decision I made quite late into writing this so the scenes only come up very late into the story.

One or more of the disciples may or may not have a tragic (depending on personal opinions) backstory that may or may not offend/disturb some readers (depending on your personal opinions/mental fortitude/openmindedness/morality/sexual orientation/real world knowledge/political agendas/reaction if someone gave you lemons/view on whether the Earth is flat or round, which I personally think it's neither and is actually a donut nom nom nom) which may or may not affect the rest of the story significantly. Consider yourself sufficiently warned.

Author's note: This story involves a lot of wish fulfillment and yes, it has harem. Still, this is my first story here in Webnovel. Some may know me better as imaginexbreaker in RoyalRoadl. I used to write World Gate Online and World Gatekeepers along with other stories but I had stopped writing them as I no longer have time after graduation. This fanfic is something I have only been casually writing in my spare time and is quite lax. Chapters would be slow, but if its popularity is good, I will try to write faster.

At the age of sixteen, he only wanted to survive in the Marvel world, where the world was destroyed at every turn and the universe was restarted.

But Alas, he was born extraordinary!

His genes mutate and evolve all the time, and all the stimuli from the outside world and all the characteristics of the enemy’s attacks will prompt him to evolve corresponding restraint methods.

At every moment, his cellular genes are rapidly mutating and evolving, and the biological evolution of tens of millions of years only takes a few seconds on him.

In this way, thousands of abilities have sprung up in his body like mushrooms after a rain.

Fantasy materializes, and what is depicted in the heart appears out of thin air; modifying the probability, tampering with all the probability of reality.

Reorganization of matter, control of subatomic reality; manipulation of space and time, control of dimension and time axis.

Even Sam Caesar himself knew that over time, he would become omniscient, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent.

By the way, this kind of existence seems to be called ‘OAA’ in this world.

Obviously, he is fully qualified for this.

To graduate from the University of the Gods, the student has to open access to a random world.

While most students gain access to worlds of swords and magic, or worlds of cultivation of immortals, Apollo gained access to the world of Naruto.

The power of the Gods grows based on the faith they receive from the believers in their worlds. While some Gods create natural disasters for humans to pray in fear, Apollo had a different idea.

In order to gain faith in the ninja world, Apollo will take advantage of the Uzumaki Clan being about to be destroyed and give hope to these abandoned people through something called the Internet.

Ninjas across the world will be shocked to discover that over the internet they can converse regardless of distance, can learn ninjustsus that only large villages know, and even can glimpse the long-awaited peace.

Based on the Internet, Apollo will connect multiple universes that he knew as movies and anime in his previous life, gather countless believers, and create the story of the greatest god in history.

His father even let him inherit more than trillions of spirit stones.

With that, he used the Grade 9 Celestial Pill to feed his dogs.
He used the famous painting that contained the will of the Supreme Sword to start a fire.
He used the Five-elements Divine Talisman to clean his ass.
And yet, he still had much more to spend. He then decided to join a clan that no one had even heard of.
He spent thousands just to see the saintess of the clan smile.
He built a pill alchemy workshop and gave out high-grade celestial herbs for free, and yet, one of the disciples who had never made a single pill was actually talented and was able to create the high-grade celestial pills.

And please don't read this if you don't like MCs who makes dumb mistake, and expect him to be some kind of badass only to complain because you didn't get what you expect.

Honestly my brain hurts how many complaints on how stupid the MC or how he doesn't utilize his full abilities like they expect it to be some kind of omnipotent ability, when it's not. You people need to learn the value of equivalent exchange, as there is no such thing as powerful ability that has no cost, and yes I also know that there are some abilities like that but this story has none of it.

And with his arrival the destiny of Westeros and the rest of the world will never be the same.

................................

This Fan-Fiction is about the Game of Thrones Series with minor elements from the books.

It is a slow paced story and therefore a bit different than my other works.

There will be a multi-pairing, but not in a typical harem setting. Meaning the MC will have multiple partners, but they do not necessarily stay with him and are not his silent trophies. Though he will of course have permanent partners.

I will upload this story monthly, but more than 35 advanced chapters of this story are on my p@treon account, which I update daily. This account isn't a priority of mine and just exists to stop others from stealing my intellectual property. (My p@treon-acc: www.p@treon.com/GodOfFreedom; Don't forget to change the @ for an a...)

Last, but not least, I don't own anything but my own characters, as I do not own the cover image, which I found on the internet. If you are the creator and want me to take it down, just send me a message or leave a comment.

Brand Mercer had it all. Women, money, properties and most importantly luck. Many attributed his riches to his unprecedented shrewdness, hustling to survive after being abandoned by his father, there seemed to have been only a single thing he inherited from him that was useful, his luck. As such there was no casino that Brand hadn't cleaned with his luck, alas... the day came for him to pay.

The goons of the most prominent casino in Las Vegas believed him to be a cheater; with no more options and surrounded by gangsters at a filthy corner filled with piss stench and rats. Mercer knew this was the end of his luck, or so he believed.

As such, with nothing else to do Brand did the only thing that could have brought him satisfaction at that very moment, just as he had done for his whole life. He kicked the leader in the balls and awaited to be battered and possibly killed.

Little did he know his luck wasn't finished, in the afterlife he met the Goddess of Luck and Causality, Sonasha; who -much to his surprise- found out that he had certainly inherited something that the goddess had left for his father.

A lifelong blessing of Luck.

But when Heaven used him in a scheme to get back at his father, Gravis realized that he needed strength to gain true freedom.

As long as he remained his weak self, he would always remain beneath Heaven’s oppression. Only true power brings true freedom.

To gain strength, Gravis ventured into the lower worlds to start his cultivation under true life and death tempering.

Only a strong will, which had been forged in striving for every resource available, would allow him to reach the peak.

Heaven’s strongest weapon was Lightning of Divine Punishment, and only if he made this weapon his, would he have a chance.

So, to overthrow Heaven,

Lightning Is the Only Way!

Yet, the path to power is painful.

Not everyone reaches the peak.

But Gravis will!

No matter how much pain he feels along the way!

- - - - -

In every love story, there's always a vengeful and venomous fiancée who was engaged to the rich and handsome CEO that fell for the poor, but gentle and innocent female lead. In his greed for her love, he broke his poor fiancée whose love drove her to the brink of insanity.

No one ever cared about how the fiancée felt.

Zhao Lifei was prepped her entire life to marry one man, but suddenly, his heart was captured by another. She was face-slapped, destroyed, and disowned for loving Zheng Tianyi. She was willing to sacrifice her youth, time, and heart for the man, but all she got was pain and despair.

It took two harsh, but awakening years for Zhao Lifei to finally understand the mistakes she has made in the past.

After her redemption, it was now Zhao Lifei's turn to experience a love grander than the female lead.

Smarter, feistier, and wittier, Zhao Lifei knew how to survive the cruel, backstabbing, and harsh upper-class society was.

""A cheating fiancé that broke my heart? Screw him, I'll find someone richer!""

""All of my friends have abandoned me? Whatever, I'll find better ones!""

""My parents disowned me? That's fine, my grandfather is wealthier and more powerful than both of them combined!""

To the polar opposite of the snarky Zhao Lifei, was the incredibly wealthy and powerful, yet ruthlessly cold Yang Feng.

Yang Feng, the King of the Business Empire, was a man to be feared. Heart of ice, eyes of stone, merciless but enticingly handsome, there was not a single person in this world that dared to offend him.

Many have tried, but none had succeeded in garnering his attention. That is, until his path unexpectedly collides with Zhao Lifei.

Challenges will arise, chaos will commence, and drama will ensue. But then again, what is a love story without disturbance? They say love without conflict is just a simple crush and the story of Zhao Lifei and Yang Feng was anything but that.

If she couldn’t eat the food of this era, couldn’t she come up with new food? And so, she made fries, grilled fish, beggar’s chicken, and various other delicacies that were not available in this future world. As a glutton, Mo Chu was satisfied with this outcome. However…
“Wow! What have I been eating all my life? Her food is so delicious, it’s amazing!”
“Aside from being delicious, the food can actually increase elemental powers, and its effects are several times better than pills!”
“I offer five million Federal Coins!”
“I offer ten million. Don’t compete with me! If you do, I’ll fight you!”
Mo Chu held up her hands in defeat, feeling helpless. It was only grilled fish. Did they have to get so excited?

Six years later, he is still that arrogant and high-profile CEO. When she accidentally gets embroiled with him again – like a canary trapped in his cage, he closes in on her. “Woman, do you think you can escape from my clutches?!""

21105271105223805,The Substitute Madam Amazes the World Once More,Urban,JQKTranslator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios,"Mo Zhu's mother remarried after her father went missing, and she had lived in the countryside with her elderly grandmother ever since. The girl who had no parents wanted to protect herself. Therefore, to avoid getting bullied, she had turned wild since she was a child—she played truant, fought, and drank. There was nothing she did not know how to do. She was a problematic student in the eyes of her teachers, a big sister in the eyes of her classmates, and a hooligan in the eyes of her acquaintances.
When she was eighteen, her birth mother retrieved her to live at her stepfather's house. Everyone in the village claimed that she was going to live a happy life in the city, that her mother had not forgotten that she had a daughter here. ""Mo Zhu, the Huo family is one of the most powerful families in the country. It's your good fortune to replace your younger sister in marrying into the Huo family. You have to cherish this opportunity,"" explained her mother patiently as she held Mo Zhu's hand. Mo Zhu's eyes were filled with sorrow. At that instant, she knew why her mother thought of her. Inviting her over to the city to enjoy life was simply a figment of her imagination—she was simply an exploitable piece of trash that her mother could sacrifice.
The Eldest Young Master of the Huo family fell severely ill recently. He did not just develop a twisted personality, but also became violent and cruel. His face had been completely ruined and he had only two years left to live. Mo Zhu's younger sister was supposed to be Eldest Young Master Huo's fiancée, but the ruined young master was no longer a suitable match. Fearing the Huo family's influences, her mother did not dare to cancel the marriage, thus she sent Mo Zhu under the bus to protect her younger sister. However, was Mo Zhu truly just a useless simpleton who knew how to smoke, drink, and fight? No! That was simply a disguise she used for self-defense since she was a girl without parents.
After marrying into the Huo family, she stopped smoking, drinking, and fighting. She became the best daughter-in-law a mother-in-law could ever have; the best wife a husband could ever have. What never occurred to anyone was she no longer flunked in her studies. In fact, she transformed into a straight-A student. Half a year later, she enrolled in the best university in the country and majored in specialized medicine. Determined to become an excellent doctor, she cured her husband's illness completely in merely two years. That handsome and suave Eldest Young Master Huo returned.
After Huo Xuan's recovery, he allocated a huge budget and held the biggest wedding of the century for Mo Zhu. During the grand wedding ceremony, Huo Xuan announced during his speech, ""In this lifetime, there are two people I'm most grateful for other than my parents. One of them is my mother-in-law. Thank you for despising me after I fell ill and forcing my wife to marry me in her younger sister's stead. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have met the most important person in my life! The second person must be my wife! She never despised me when I was at my lowest. Instead, she takes good care of me. She's an angel sent by God, and she has saved me with her forgiveness and kindness, granting me a second chance at life.""",520.0,3500000.0,35,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/21105271105223805?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1631158040677

Pokemon is owned by Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures Inc. I just use their sandbox for the plot of my MC and my OCs.


This will be a ""slow"" paced story, in fact it's ""super slow paced"", so please don't expect the MC to directly start his journey in 20 chapters or so, actually multiply that by like 15. A lot is going to happen before that happens. The first 10-20 chapters or so are information heavy, depending on what kind of reader you are.

I have a patre*n for those that want to support me with access to some advance chapters as a thank you.

This is an alternate pokemon universe so there will be differences to the games, manga and anime. So if something in the story is different it is most likely on purpose. The original sources are seen as suggestions not laws.

Differences can be:
Type variants, evolution conditions, strength mechanics, world building and more.


If I am at some point asking for reader input I will do so but otherwise I will ignore most suggestions. So please don't spam things like catch this pokemon or do that next.

I have my plot planned and external input will be considered when asked for. If I see a suggestion that I believe fit my plot flow I will use it and will credit the commentor.


Comments on spelling and grammar mistakes are welcome. I will try to correct said mistakes with time.

Constructive criticism will be read and considered. Insult and hate comments will be ignored or deleted depending on severity.

Readers naturally can comment their dislike but one worders will be ignored. If the reason for the dislike is explained I will read it. Like previously mentioned pure insults and hate comments will be ignored or deleted.

The same is true for simple hate reviews or insulting ones. Reviews conplaining about something I warned about, such as the slow pace, will be deleted as well.",209.0,700.0,"1,185",https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/20717491805058705?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1630170735372

The three of them were cursed by Selene because of their ferocious action to gain supreme power and authority.

The moon goddess didn’t bless them with a mate as a punishment of their atrocious way and forced them to involve in this deadly war with the demons.

“You will turn us into a slave for those sickly creatures!?” Torak asked incredulously. “Aren’t you afraid that we will snap them into two?”

The guardian angel was so fragile and they as lycanthropes didn’t appreciate the weaknesses.

“No, you will not.” Selene said patiently. “You will not be their slave nor hurt them, you will cherish them in every way possible.”

Jedrek laughed menacingly upon hearing this, they didn’t care about the resurrected of the beast, once they crossed their territory, with or without the guardian angel he would tear their body apart. “I will be the last person they will see, once I find them.” He was referring to both the guardian angel and the demon.

But, the next voice from Selene was laced with mirth when she spoke.

“You will not hurt your mate.”

During a fire, the nation’s first love was disfigured, and her future was ruined! Her fiancé was disgusted by her face and broke off their engagement. Her adopted mother regarded her as the dirt on her shoes and chased her out of the family.

She then wrote a letter to break off the engagement and another to cast off her family before she left!

After Yu Huang left, the people in the entertainment industry said that after she left, she dyed her hair red, wore a veil, and went to nightclubs every day!

But some thought that she went into detention centers.

Just when everyone thought that Yu Huang abandoned herself to a life of degeneracy, was sent into jail, and could no longer create any sensational news, Yu Huang got herself trending again.

Education Department of Prosperous City: We congratulate Eternal High School’s Yu Huang for becoming the top scorer with 7xx points! Congratulations on being admitted into Divine Academy! That is the academy that will only take in 10 geniuses every year!

From then on, Yu Huang began her counterattack. She was reborn, and she shocked the whole world!

Sheng Xiao was the greatest genius Divine Academy ever had, and his looks, too, were one of a kind. But he was an aloof person who did not fall for any woman’s flirting. Hence, he was known as the Aloof King of Hell.

One day, someone saw him pin Yu Huang in a corner and grab her hand. He said, “You can predict the future. Tell me, are you the only person in my future?”

Yu Huang looked into his future, and she shook her head. “No. You have a pair of cute, lively children in your future too.”",298.0,9836597.0,104,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/22200124005876805?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1642053448967

But that was only the prologue of my adventure... I was reincarnated in the world of My Hero Academia as the little brother of the protagonist with a wonderful and terrifying quirk of intelligence.

With great power comes great responsibility… Hah! Boring! I will use the power of my twisted imagination to have a lot of fun in this world by unleashing chaos around me while I enjoy the show eating popcorn.

Sometimes a child just wants to see the world burn...

A fantastic giant robot! A really cool lightsaber! Robotic tentacles! Anything my twisted mind can imagine! I'll build it! And I plan to have a lot of fun in the process!

So I became the youngest S-Rank Villain in the world, created an evil organization for my amusement, and as if that wasn't enough… I completely altered the plot for my personal benefit.

And the best of all! No one suspects that Izuku Midoriya's innocent and charismatic little brother is really the mastermind behind all this chaos!

“I am Child Emperor! And this world will become my playground!” I exclaimed happily, raising my fists in the air in front of a terrified crowd of heroes and villains.

""HAIL HYDRA!""

I exclaimed defiantly from atop a gigantic combat robot as a crooked smile spread across my face. Something tells me there will be no school tomorrow... Hehe.

Knowing that, everyone ran away from Felix without realizing they were creating their own monster.

A blessing and a curse, Felix's quirk directed him toward the path people scorned. A path that led him to a prison cell. Blasé by his life within these four concrete walls, he accepted a deal with the Canadian and Japanese authorities—who decided to free him earlier as a bargaining chip to avoid the impending war between the Ring of Fire allies and the West.

Embracing his role as a tool to avoid an all-out superhero war, Felix is sent to the Land of the Rising Sun with a few ideas in mind.

The Japanese government that wanted to use him for their ploys soon realized that they had freed someone driven by a not-so-familiar ambition and inhabited by a strange malice that even All for One would struggle to grasp. As they say, those who play with fire often risk getting burned.

Men and women with power that leaves the world and all the insignificant lives upon it at their mercy. Many choose to exercise that power for selfish means, but a small group, a fraction of them; chose to use their power to defend the weak. They are the heroes of this world, the ones who risk their lives and sacrifice everything they are just to protect those that cannot protect themselves from the villains who would take everything from them.

Yet even these heroes, are flawed. They are not perfect despite their image of such. They are not all-powerful despite their actions speaking to the contrary. They make mistakes, allow emotion to cloud their judgement, and allow pride to stay their hand.

He breaks the cycle and wades through the world of heroes and villains, forged by his actions and the actions of those around him.

Note:
Needless to say, this book has the same idea as ""Creating The Manga Of Naruto On Naruto World Become My Ultimate Goal!"" But here it applies to the world of One Piece, I was inspired by the idea and I wanted to apply it to the world of One Piece, and I hope it succeeds, of course, there will be a conspiracy and I will make sure to improve the story according to the readers opinions.

¶¶¶¶¶

As for publishing chapters, it would depend entirely on the interaction the story receives, whether it is 4 chapters a day or 2 chapters or 1 chapter or 0 chapters... It all depends on the readers' enthusiasm for this interesting book.

¶¶¶¶¶

I don't own One Piece nor do I own its characters, all I own is the protagonist, after all, this is just a fanfic without any profit, just for fun.

I don't own Bleach, Attack on titan, Hunter X Hunter, Naruto, and I don't own their characters.

Someone exclaimed, “My Renewable Resources attribute allows me to enhance raw materials such as timber and minerals. I want to build the strongest empire of commerce!”

Life is filled with the unexpected.

Today is another normal day in life, as I passed the time with my friends to bully the cursed superd child feared in the village to show our might to her.

A water ball suddenly hit us.

The kid from the knight's office was unleashing his spell to attack us, the bully.

Never would I expect that simple water ball to create a trigger for memories to fill my brain.

I was 5 at that time, and the memories were jumbled. I don't know whether it’s mine or another's. I just know that this is not a memory of a single person.

And, from that memory, I know that I’m actually a mob...

I’m one of Sylphiette’s bullies.

You won’t know me since I am not named in any of the works, whether they were manga, novels, or even anime. Heck, I only say one word and I'm dead in the next part.

an actual mob, where I don’t even appear in either the opening or the ending of the anime.

The thing happened so suddenly.

I don’t know whether I am reincarnated, transmigrated, or just receiving some memories from someone in the real world.

The deadline is 5 years from now, the day the Metastasis incident happened. Can I be another prodigy in the Mushoku Tensei world, or will I still be another slightly better mob?

Fang Ping was blind. By chance, he transmigrated to another world. Upon his arrival, he was ambushed by a ferocious beast. Fortunately for him, he was rescued by a woman. After being saved, he discovered that this world also used English. However, to his surprise, the denizens of this world had proficiency below that of a kindergartener from his world. Yet alone say an entire sentence, they even fumbled about pronouncing single words.
Coincidentally, he awakened the Master Teacher System. In order to repay them for saving his life, he decided to stay and teach them English.
He began by teaching them to recognize the alphabet and then phonetics and finally began to teach them vocabulary.
However, Fang Ping was unaware that his students were abnormal. They were the famous night elves, and the person who had saved him was the next queen of the night elves clan. She was the daughter of the current queen.
The English that he was teaching was the vocabulary of this world’s magic spells. Hence, the weak night elves began mastering magic spells and their forces grew powerful once again.
Five years later, Fang Ping opened his eyes.
He looked at the people of all races kneeling before him. It was as though a whole country had come to the royal court.

""Bring the man here.""

""N-now?"" stuttered the butler. It was the time of night.

Damien who hadn't broken his eye contact with the girl in front of him, pushed his hand against the wall which now rested beside his beautiful girl's head. Turning his body, he first looked at his butler who had his head bowed. With great courage, the butler came to meet his Master's eyes, ""Do you have any other better time? Or should it be after I wring your neck?"" Damien asked calmly tilting his head. Not a second later, the butler ran out of the room to return back with Mr. Reverale after twenty minutes.

""Damien, are we having a late tea party?"" Mr. Reverale came to greet but the master of the house had other plans. Spotting the knife that was stuck to the apple on the table, he reached for it to pull it out.

Just as Mr. Reverale went to exchange a handshake with him, Damien took hold of his hand to place it on the table. In one swift movement as if he were chopping onions, he chopped the four fingers of the man off his hand making him yelp and cry in pain.

""No one touches what is mine. I am sure this will remind you the next time you even think about touching her,"" sighed Damien as if he were tired of telling people to keep their dirty hands off his belongings.

Each individual was given a talent to start with, ranging from simple abilities like enhanced eyesight to insane fantasy stuff like pyrokinesis.

And within this myriad of abilities, Damien awakened a spatial affinity with the skill “short-distance teleportation”.

At first, he was excited, thinking about intense battles and gaining great power, but the reality was quick to shoot him down.

His ability only worked in the area 10 meters around himself, and his physical stats were insanely weak, leaving him tired after using his ability a couple of times.

Disillusioned by his weakness, Damien lived a quiet life doing anything he could to meet ends meet, until one day, everything changed.

Damien was betrayed and thrown into a gate, left to fend for himself in a labyrinth of beasts.

Something snapped in him that day. He refused to stay weak and keep his head down any longer.

When he emerged from the darkness, he found himself in a new world with no idea how to return to earth.

However, he wasn’t the same kid he was when he first fell.

A/N: Hentai ability; It means this will have an erotic theme going for it. The story revolves around superheroes(Various anime characters: Whitebeard, Tsunade, and so on), the mc getting stronger, the world and its various plots, but also about his sexual journey which will be quite detailed. Those chapters will be tagged +18, so you can skip them, but as you read in the synopsis, his ability is related to that, so the smut will always be brought back into the picture. His ability is similar to the dual cultivation techniques in Chinese novels just to paint a picture of what's in store. But there will be no cultivation BS like realms and stuff. Well, read and see for your own.

23120464806275505,Omega's Rebirth,Fantasy,JHeart,"What was worse than death itself? Well it was dying knowing that no one would miss you, knowing that your death was a favour to everyone you ever knew.

This was exactly how I felt the day I died.

I was the love child of the Eclipse Alpha King, in a time where the mate bond was considered sacred, a child born out of wedlock was nothing short of sacrilegious...

'It was his fault, he loved someone other than his mate...'

'It was his fault, he had carnal knowledge of a human woman.'

'It was all his fault, my only crime was being born out of his lust.'

But why was that Alpha King father of mine perfectly safe, while I was hated, scorned and blamed for everything instead?

Why did I have to be my father's bargaining chip, used to achieve his goals?

Why could I not get a rejection like everyone else but was instead murdered by my own mate?

Why was I killed before I even had a chance to live?

I had a thousand questions and yet there was no one to answer and this was exactly how I died...

So why then did my eyes flutter open to that day, a month before my death?

Was it because of my little secret?

A secret I will tell no one else but you...

From the title of my tale, you must think I am an omega wolf...

No, you got it wrong... I am not an Omega wolf, I am an Alpha wolf and my name is Omega.

21372970505068005,The Cursed Prince's Strange Bride,Fantasy,ThatAmazingGirl,"The biggest mistake of Alicia's life, was trying to commit suicide.

She found herself in the body of a 19 years old princess in exile, in the middle ages.
What's more? She was forced to marry Prince Harold; the infamous white-haired hot tempered Prince who wouldn't mind killing someone for the most irrelevant reason.

Now, her wedding is only a few hours from now and the 'princess', which happens to be Alicia, is supposed to display some 'princessly' skills to the guest.

Quick question: Is twerking allowed in the middle ages?

She knew one thing for sure, the wedding was going to be a disaster and the hot tempered prince was going to kill her before she found her way back home.

God Help Her!

ThatAmazingGirl in collaboration with Miss_Behaviour (The writers of In Love With A Klepto) is bringing you another book.
""THE CURSED PRINCE'S STRANGE BRIDE""

What would you do if you suddenly found yourself in the body of a princess in the ancient time?
What's more, he isn't only a werewolf, he is also cursed by the moon goddess.

EXCERPT:

What should she do? She was confused and had no idea what was going on. Weddings in the middle ages was weird! What the hell is 'Virtues recitation'?

Should she pretend to faint? That was the only thought that made sense. So that was what she did.
She slowly collapsed on the ground and heard how everyone began to gasp and exclaim. 

Alicia wanted them to take her out of there and then she would find a way to escape. But maybe she was unlucky after all, because when she peeped under her lashes, wondering why no one was coming to carry her out, she saw a golden robe, before the person crouched down in front of her.

She shut her eyes tightly and stilled her breath. She was an actress, after all. She could pull this off flawlessly. 

""That was a bad act, my lady."" The deep voice spoke, causing goosebumps to rise on her skin.

Scary.

""I will only give you three seconds to get up."" 

His voice wasn't really threatening, but somehow he commanded fear, especially with the slow and careful way he spoke. She had heard he was bad-tempered. What would he do after the three seconds passed? Would he kill her? Then would she die here? How did he even know she was pretending? Were people in the middle ages usually smart?

She opened one eye to peek at him and saw him staring right at her with a smirk. 

THERE WAS NO WAY THE WEDDING WASN'T HAPPENING. SHE WAS SO DEAD!

""Everly, I know you can't hear me...but, will you reject me if I tell you how I truly feel?"" His calm cynical tone sounded.
......

Twenty-five-year-old Everly Eloise, a pure-blooded orphan werewolf, is hired by a wealthy man who suddenly needs a caregiver.
 
She accepted the job, but one thing she didn’t anticipate was his monstrous side. The side of him that the media never showed, or at least never even knew of.
 
Valerio Avalanzo was a wealthy European man who was betrayed by his lover, leaving him in a condition that he very well hid from the entire world.
 
The incident caused him to drastically change. He became cold-hearted, feared by most, unsociable, emotionless, and, worst of all, developed a deep hatred for the word ""love.""
 
For a man who was blind and held such deep hatred for love, it was believed that he was emotionally incapable of loving anyone, therefore leaving the world with this perception of him.
 
But what happens when he meets Everly Eloise, his caregiver?
 
Will his heart win, or will his hatred for love win? And what happens when he discovers that Everly is not just his caregiver but a werewolf as well? The creatures that have been an enemy of his kind for centuries?

And, was their encounter decided by fate or maybe it's a given chance? A chance given to each of their hearts to heal?

As he breathes his last, he hears the echoes of mechanical voices resonating in his head, granting him a multitude of wishes in the form of Skills, Fortunes, and a new Body.

Reborn as an Ice Dragon, Drake finds himself thrust into a fantastical realm reminiscent of Norse Mythology known as Yggdrasil. This world, however, holds more surprises than he could have ever imagined. It is not only a realm of fantasy but also a Cultivation World, blending two seemingly disparate concepts into one.

Join him on his journey as he explores this enchanting world, navigating its treacherous landscapes and encountering deadly monsters along the way. As he fights for survival, he seeks to find his place in this new existence and discover the purpose that drives him forward.

Yet, he soon realizes that he is not alone in this reincarnated state. Others have been granted wishes as well, and the collision of their desires threatens to plunge the world into utter chaos.

I would never marry you if I knew that your sister was the one who saved me.” Yun Xi was dumbstruck. It was actually her who saved Mo Ran! She struggled to look at her sister, Yun Lian to see what was going on. Yet, what she saw made her heart sink into her stomach. Yun Lian lowered her gaze as she said, “Sister, I’m sorry. My Brother-in-law and I truly love each other. I’ve been hiding this for so long now, and I can’t hide it any longer.”
Yun Xi suddenly felt her world spin, and the past flashed through her head. Her sister had always asked her about how she saved Mo Ran in detail and constantly stood between her and Mo Ran. He gradually became more distant from her - was that all for the sake of today?
Yun Xi and Yun Lian are twins, but because Yun Xi was always been better in her studies and had a better husband, both society and their parents showed their bias toward Yun Xi. However, Yun Xi would always tolerate and dote on Yun Lian, giving Yun Lian most of her opportunities, including the precious chance to go to school. Staring at her husband’s icy expression, Yun Xi dragged her sickly body to the window and jumped down.
When she opened her eyes, Yun Xi realized that she was not dead. Instead, she had returned to that summer day when she was competing with Yun Lian for an opportunity to go to school. It was on this day that Yun Xi offered her most precious opportunity! Now that she was given another chance at life, Yun Xi swore to take back what was hers. Whatever Yun Lian took from her, she would have Yun Lian pay everything back! As for her ex-husband, Mo Ran, Yun Xi decided to let Yun Lian have him. Yun Xi did not want him anymore.

She imagines that she's the only transmigrator here and has to be careful. Who knew—
The first baby: Cold and stern, he's a young little adult who acts as a judge! He steps forward to draw a bolt of lightning from the heavens to punish scumbags.
The second baby: Agile, lively, and extremely smart. Every time he moves his mouth, he can accurately predict the future!
The third baby: One with an even colder personality, with a single wave of his finger, he can hook out your soul and play with it!
Ye Lulu never had a boyfriend in the modern world. Yet, who would have expected that the moment she changed into a different identity, she would have children, a husband, and in-laws — basically, the whole package? Initially, she says, ""The three babies are so cute. They're my biological children. I can have them! As for my husband… I'll get a refund.""
Unexpectedly, Ye Lulu gradually realizes that her husband is very handsome! He seems very mysterious and charming! She seems to have developed feelings for him. How wonderful!
However, Ye Lulu holds onto her little protective mask tightly and constantly warns herself to be conservative, as people in the ancient times are comparatively not as open-minded.
Unexpectedly, that husband of hers is not himself either. He was a Yin God from the divine throne in the heavens where there were no restrictions, and thus is even more casual. One day, her handsome and god-like husband presses her against the wall and lifts his hand to hold her chin. He says to her in a husky voice, ""I think I like you…""

25317245706813005,A Vampire in My Wife is a Beautiful CEO,Anime & Comics,Photosphere,"This is a repost from my previous fanfic [The Vampire of Wall Street]

The Vampire Alucard finds himself sitting on his throne, the story has reached the conclusion and there is no after story, only darkness and loneliness.
His master is gone, his draculine is gone. Only the putrid remains of a protestant mansion remain with vagrant sullying its corners and humidity rusting every bit of pure wood remaining.
It is fair to ask, what is more rotten, that wood, or his very nosferatu soul.
A silhouette that he recognises well arises in front; the culprit to his eternal life, God.
""I want to offer you a second chance Count, this place is no longer suitable for you.""
After entering a mysterious door, the vampire Alucard finds himself in a nation he never thought he'd visit again, China... but things have changed and this is not the same dimension. Not the same world, not the same Queen, not even the same date.
Coming back he's given another chance... since he can't die. Might as well live a life worth living.

**
**
THERE IS NO NTR IN THIS STORY.
I hope you enjoy this story reboot, I'm going to try and fix mistakes that I did in my first run. Bear in mind that the Alucard I'm writing is according to the original anime and OVAs, there will be instances in which I'm going to need to change his personality slightly to fit the story. That said, enjoy.

It is one of my very old drafts. I wrote this about a year ago and it was 'gathering dust', unfinished with me having no motivation to continue. I decided to just post whatever was already written in hopes it would provide someone with an enjoyable evening. It is a better alternative than me just deleting it, no?

I'll give you a fair warning. The probability of encountering grammatical mistakes is fairly high as I don't feel like proofreading an old draft of mine.

As for the cringe name... it is what it is :).

The story has exactly 85 chapters written and I will be posting 4 per week because of course I can't just dump it here all at once. Where would be the fun in that?

21283601205813505,Gods' Impact Online,Games,NoWoRRyMaN,"[WPC #220 - Gold Place Winner!]

In the future timeline, Humankind had developed things that brought a revolution to the world. But their best invention was fully immersive VR games that became more and more advanced as time passed. They could create new worlds— in virtual reality, that were more beautiful and profound than the real world they lived in.

Upon seeing how Humankind started discarding the world created by the gods and embracing the fake world created by humans, the gods were enraged.

Thus, gods transmigrated the souls of all the VR game players into the game created by gods—called Gods' impact, which was unlike any VR game. It was too surreal with daily struggles, quests, systems, monsters, and... more deadly and cruel than the real world.

However, they could use their real-life skills and talents in the game. They could use the real world money into the game. As they evolved in the game, their body also changed in real life. Furthermore, the players who died in the game also died in the real world.

How will Zach, who just happened to try out the VR game for the first time, only to be transported into Gods’ impact, survive?

""Everyone's stats are limited. I will become limitless by cultivating infinite MP!"" Zach announced nonchalantly when he realized he might be the strongest player in the game.

Little did the gods know that they would regret messing with Zach, and his existence alone would become a threat to them.
---
Note- Video games, fantasy, and realistic logic are applied in this Gods' Impact. But don't forget that the sole purpose of this game was for gods to screw over humans in every way possible.

With his Bloodline Power far beyond any Devil-Fruit, reviving the Senju Clan, and finding the One Piece - both can be done without any issue. Right?

Author Note: The Senju Clan exists in this story, coming from Wano, and Chakra is their bloodline power. So yes, this has some AU elements due to the merge of this and chat; while keeping One Piece Lore mostly the same.

In the year 3000, humanity was forced to leave the Earth when a sudden mutation caused more than 70% of the planet's population to mutate either into zombies, werewolves or vampires. The humans put up a fight but didn't have a chance against the united front of the monsters, and they were forced to leave. At least those who were rich and lucky enough to leave.

A century later, the chaos on earth had calmed down, but the humans who were left behind were treated like slaves and were forced to join one of the three factions: The Undead, The Cold Ones or The Lycans when they turned 16.

It was a similar story for Ashton, who was one week away from being turned into one of the monsters as it was his 16th birthday. He decided to run away from his fate and join the secret resistance to battle against the monsters.

However, his plans came to a standstill when a series of misfortunes led him to be bitten by a Zombie, a Vampire and a werewolf before either of his powers could manifest.

He ended up receiving all of their powers but at the cost of his humanity. Yet, he wasn't willing to let his humanity die. No matter the cost.

Will he be able to live his life, or is it already too late? Which faction will he join? Will he be able to find the secret behind the mutation?

There were too many questions, and only one way to find the answers: follow Ashton's journey as he fights back to retain his humanity.

22245612906352605,The Heiress Strikes Back,Urban,Give Me BuffTranslator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios,"Sharon was an ordinary person, while her husband, Wallace Harris, was a promising and handsome man. His family was one of the most prestigious and wealthiest families in New York City. Being able to marry Wallace was an accident.

Throughout their three years of marriage, Wallace had never slept with Sharon. His family also kept persuading him to divorce Sharon.

It was the birthday party of the Harris family's old matriarch, and all youngsters of the Harris family had given the most expensive gifts possible to make the old lady happy—everyone but Sharon. She asked to borrow money from Madam Harris for the old housekeeper, Uncle Smith, as he had no money to pay for his medical treatment. But as expected, the Harris family humiliated her when she requested.

""The Harris family has never had a poor relative like you. Don't you ever appear in front of me again! Wallace should've married Crystal. She's certainly a young lady who's worthy of marrying into our family!"" said Madam Harris.

""Please know your place and get out of here. Don't stay at our house anymore. How can Wallace's grandfather be so foolish to marry a poor, useless woman like you to my son?!"" said June, Wallace's mother.

""It's just a few million dollars, yet you're so poor that you need to borrow from our family. How can a woman like you deserve to be with Wallace? If it were Crystal, she definitely wouldn't have embarrassed us so much!""

That night, Wallace handed Sharon a bank card, which contained millions of dollars. ""The company is developing, so I don't have much cash. You can use this to help Uncle Smith.""

Facing the Harris family's hostility, Wallace stated, ""Since I have married her, she is my responsibility. Regardless of her being rich or poor, Sharon is my wife.""

It wasn't until a stranger approached Sharon one day. Only then did Sharon know that she was the daughter of a top prestigious family, who was eligible to receive assets worth at least ten billion.

She suddenly owned the largest company in New York and a bank card that contained hundreds of millions of 'pocket money.'

In the blink of an eye, her identity had changed. She was no longer the poor daughter-in-law that wasn't favored by the Harris family. Instead, she had become the most prestigious person in New York!",206.0,9846790.0,37,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/22245612906352605?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1646119261845

Authors note:
Hello! This will be my first fanfiction on this site. I'm a big fan of both Danmachi and Type moon so I had this idea of a crossover fanfiction for a while.

First off, this story will mostly be the same as the canon of the original danmachi with the inclusion of some fate characters in the world to spice this up.

Secondly, I plan to make this story a harem, though I don't intend to make it so that every girl immediately falls in love with the MC for an arbitrary reason. I'll try my best to flesh out each romantic partner in a way that isn't like a stereotypical anime romance.

Thirdly, The mc isn't going to be some chad thunderc*ck guy. He will have the sensibilities to recognize and acknowledge the horrible stuff in the world, but will not be some innocent snowflake like the original bell nor a murderous maniac pragmatist.

Lastly, though I included the R18 tag, I am still developing my skills to write lemons. So don't expect too much of those. Though I will promise it will happen sometime in the future.",108.0,81.0,51,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/25165772405069005?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1671704120307

For the sake of getting a smile from her parents and some false praise, she lived frugally until she almost died. Looking back on her life, Yu Bing felt it was absurd, and endless resentment festered in her heart. She had never done anything to anyone, so why? Why did those relatives and close family members treat her this way? Since they didn’t want her, well, then she wouldn’t treat them like family anymore.

Since he was a child, Isaac was unable to improve his strength no matter how much he tried, like he was cursed by the Gods.

One day, a massive snowstorm struck the peaceful city of Snowstar, wreaking havoc in a peaceful community. Young Isaac was wandering alone in the forest when the snowstorm struck, seeking adventures and excitement, but instead, he found something else that completely changed him and his future.

Several years later, Isaac suffered an incident caused by his jealous classmates, which bedridden him for several months, but after the traumatizing experience, doctors thought that it would take him years before he could overcome his trauma, but against all odds... He overcame it in 2 weeks!

Being heavily sheltered and protected by his family after the incident, Isaac's life seemed dull and kind of boring, but then... The highly anticipated VRMMORPG White Online was released. Without thinking twice, Isaac bought the cheapest VR Helmet available and entered the new world with almost zero expectations, but excited nonetheless.

This is the story of Isaac Whitelock, who will rise from being a protected and weak individual to being one of the sole hopes of the entire Human race.

Is death the end or a new begining? I don't know. But, for our protagonist, it was the latter.

Max, a twenty-year-old virgin, got attacked by a bear in forest and died a rather unwilling and untimely death.

Fortunately for him... that wasn't the end to his story.

He woke up and found himself transmigrated in a world full of magic, wonders and... beautiful women.

God seemed to be happy with him because not only was he a noble's youngest son in this world, he also got a system -The Lust System- to become the strongest mage and reach the heights that no one had ever reached.

Everything seemed amazing but was it true or just an illusion?

Join the Exciting journey of Maxwell Garfield in this wonderful world to rise to the top.

______________________________

[Things to be noted]

1. From the title, you should've guessed it already but let me tell you the story will be filled with many sexual adventures. So... you are welcome to enjoy them.....

2. However... don't expect MC to have sexual relations with every woman he meets. I'll be focusing on the story, and would 'Try' not to blindly throw sex scenes left and right.

3. Most importantly, this is my first time writing so the the quality of first 50 or so may be a bit lacking (But it would cause you no problem if a few minor errors don't bother you).

4. It is a slow paced story. If you want everything to be explosive and fast, maybe this isn't for you.

Important Note: If you enjoy the story then don't forget to
vote your GTs, Power stones and also if you can, send some GIFTS too. This poor soul would appreciate it.

Also check out My other work: [ Rise of the Strongest War God ] & [ My perverted devil system ]

(A/N: I came back to writing recently and was fairly rusty (I didn’t write for almost a year) and lazy. I was doing short chapters and dragging things out far to long in my last story. This is my redemption story, so to speak. I’ve learned from it and hopefully this one will be better. Also, the romance will start earlier since I’m not writing about 11 year old kids going to magical schools anymore. Lol)

Xu Youyou, daughter of the Xu family who had been sent to the countryside to nurse her health years ago, had returned to uphold the marriage promise with the Lin family. On the eve of her wedding, the groom escaped abroad in search of his dream girl. The crowd gasped and watched on excitedly. Xu Youyou’s only comment was, “Okay.” The next instant, her fair hands had seized the collar of a man’s shirt as she asked sweetly, “Mr. Mo, can you marry me?” The business tycoon, Mo Shenbai, was aloof, abstinent, mysterious, and kept a low profile. Having dominated the challenging business industry for ten years, no media was bold enough to post a picture of him, and no woman was able to catch his eye. Everyone said that Mo Shenbai’s marriage with Xu Youyou was only a contract, and they would surely divorce after a year. Xu Youyou was happily reading these rumors about her, but then she noticed something was off, She didn’t have to pay for her shopping, nor choose her food, and everyone would ardently greet her wherever she went, calling her “Mrs. Xu.” Then, Mo Shenbai’s dream girl came back, and Xu Youyou’s ex-fiance confessed, “Youyou, only my love for you is true. Come back to me. I won’t dislike you.” Before Xu Youyou could answer him, the domineering man embraced her and said in a low and seductive voice, “Baby, didn’t you tell him that you already have a proof of our love in here?” He placed his warm hand on her flat tummy.

22444196205335305,The Counselor - A Group Chat Story,Anime & Comics,Zevren,"(Semi-Excerpt from Novel)

Jacob wearily reached for his phone as he felt it go off in his pocket. After another day of job searching he was hoping for some good news as he glanced at the screen…

‘New Invitation to Group chat.’

“Huh, must be some of the guys.” Giving a quick shrug and settling into his car he let a small breath of air out, resting his tired legs.

[New Group chat, ‘Multiverse Counselling group’, entered , name set to, ‘The Counselor’, by ‘Admin’.]

“What???.... ohh shit. Was this the job I applied to when I was drunk?”

He wanted to face palm in that moment, after so long, he might have finally caught a break and he couldn’t actually do his job! There was a slump in his shoulders as he clicked into the group, expecting to see some information about the job he had applied for, but instead it was empty.

His eyebrow quirked for a second at the descrepency before finally letting out a small chuckle as he figured it out. His friends were messing with him….A sigh left his lips as he lowered the phone, he knew he shouldn’t have gotten his hopes up.

Rolling his eyes he reached forwards, he may as well roast some of the guys before he heads home and has his nice hot shower. There were 4 new messages in the chat.

[Darth Vader has Joined the group.]
[Ruin Princess has Joined the Group.]
[Phoenix has joined the group.]
[Dark Knight has joined the group.]

Ok now he knew it was a bloody joke. He could only shake his head as he started typing.

-10 minutes later-

I get paid for giving out some stupid ‘life counselling’? My Arse, I’ll give your ‘characters’ some life counselling!

The Counselor: (Fine I’ll start with the easy one, Yo Anakin, Palpatine is a Sith lord, he’s been playing you for years and guess what turns you to the dark side, oooooh soo scary. Lock him the fuck up or kill him who cares, leave the Jedi, get your wife pregnant and go be an actual dad you prick and have a nice life.)

Darth Vader: (I don’t know what game your playing, but you should know Jedi don’t have relationships.)

The Counselor: (Rias, pull your finger out of your ass and start training, the fact that some pervert with a sacred gear is what saves you in the end from your arranged marriage is honestly embarrassing, seeing as you’re the little sister of the bloody devil in charge. Get your shit together woman.)

Ruin Princess: (What?!?!?!?!)

The Counselor: (Jean, I mean I can’t fault your problems, you’ve basically got a split personality because the bold bastard screwed around with your head, not to mention your husband having a Psychic affair later in life. Get your mind sorted out then come and talk to me.)

Pheonix: (What is a Psychic affair? And who was my husband…)

The Counselor: (Bruce, honestly not much wrong with you, well other than you beat the shit out of people in a giant bat suit, but honestly a lot of good work, if you don’t include all your protégés either dying or leaving you and how most of your contingencies usually come around to bite you in the arse. Ehh I guess stop being so paranoid and shit might work out, You’re welcome.”

The Dark Knight: (…)

The Counselor: (There you all got some ‘life counselling, now fuck off you’ve had your fun I’ll talk to you guys later!)

-12 hours later-

Jacob Stared at his bank account gobsmacked.

“Holy shit I got paid!!!!”

Please give me suggestions in comments for people to add to the chat group, I will consider ever person listed.
Because I know some are wondering, SINGLE PAIRING, NO HAREM.

She did not expect to transmigrate into a romance novel that her friend had arranged for her to read and become a female supporting character with the same name in the novel. Yu Han expressed her dissatisfaction. What right did others have to transmigrate into the female protagonist while she could only be a female supporting character? Wait a minute! Yu Han was suddenly excited because, in the novel, her fiancé was the top celebrity in the novel, Ji Jun. He was also her favorite man in the novel because he was the only one who did not have a brainless crush on the female protagonist in the novel. Now, this man was her fiancé! It was rumored that the top male idol in showbiz, Ji Jun, had a crush on someone. His fans, “Impossible, I don't believe it. Brother loves us!” When they heard that the person Ji Jun had a crush on was Yu Han, his fans, “ It's impossible.

Epilogue 1: ""Shocking! The popular female star, Yu Han, sold her body to seduce a seventy-year-old man for the sake of stardom. Here is a picture as proof!""

Are you doubting my professional ethics?"" Yu Han, ""…"" A certain female star in the same production crew just finished shooting a scene where she fell into the water.

Seeking solace, he turns to alcohol, hoping to numb the pain. But when he wakes the next day, he finds himself in a strange new world, gifted with powers he unknowingly acquired in his intoxicated state.

Exploring this unfamiliar realm, he uncovers hidden truths about himself, unlocking a wellspring of abilities he never knew existed. Driven by an unwavering desire to be reunited with his parents, he embarks on a quest to understand his newfound powers and the world that now surrounds him.

Throughout his journey, he forms alliances, overcomes adversaries, and lends a helping hand to those in need. If there are also those who pose a threat to his loved ones. He confronts these challenges head-on, employing diverse strategies beyond mere violence.
From Solo Leveling to The Beginning After The End to Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, follow this man's story as he tries to make sense of his new reality and find his way back to his loved ones.
….

Before you begin reading the story, I'd like to share a few important points. The main character (MC) is a good-natured and cheerful person, so don't expect him to become excessively violent or aggressive from the start. However, he won't let others walk all over him and will deal with anyone he sees as a potential threat. How he handles these situations won't always involve violence, but you'll understand more about this as you progress into the second part of the story.

The first part is meant to be uplifting and doesn't involve much danger because the MC is already powerful. Its purpose is mainly to introduce the MC's personality and the female characters who will develop romantic feelings for him.

I did my best with my writing skills at the time, so I apologize if it's not as good as you'd like.

Your feedback and thoughts are welcome, as I value your input. While this story can be enjoyed as a lighthearted harem fanfic commonly found in web novels, if you take the time to explore the sentences and scenarios, you'll find deeper meaning beneath the surface.

Ultimately, it's up to you as the reader to interpret and decide whether it's a typical fanfic with an overpowered MC and a harem or something more meaningful when read with greater thought and investment. I've learned this through my writing experiences.

Give it a try and let me know your thoughts after reading.

I deeply appreciate all of my readers, and I am truly grateful to those who enjoy reading this story. Your support means a lot to me. At the same time, I want to apologize to those who didn't find it appealing or satisfying. Anyway thanks for taking the time to engage with my work, and I will try to improve and deliver content that you may like one day.

That is all, Thank you for reading.


Note: This story is a fan fiction and I do not own any of the characters. For those interested, you can join the Discord link provided or check out my Patreon to read ahead.

23871034106159805,Majesty's Journey 2: Natasha's Symbiote in Marvel,Anime & Comics,That_One_Dead_Ali,"an earthling dies in our universe. but fortunately for him, an Omniversal being who was bored without having anything to do for who knows how many years, decided to reincarnate him with a few wishes!

but Ali's{the Majestic one / Majesty} wishes weren't normal. he didn't wish to be a Saiyan. he didn't wish to a Kryptonian. he chose to be... a SYMBIOTE with unlimited evolution and growth!

and his host? his host will be the one loved by all, the one and only, black widow, Natasha Romanoff!

but he also wished for something more. to have his soul turned to pieces and sent to different multiverses in the unending Omniverse. such as the douluo dalu multiverse and Yu-Gi-Oh multiverse while this Ali was sent to marvel.

but one day, they will all unite, and they will complete the puzzle that is their soul. and on that day, he will become one of the strongest beings in all of the omniverse!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I just wanted to warn you all and clear some misunderstandings:

1: This story is being rewritten because I wasn't satisfied with how I wrote it originally.

you may have seen a review here and there that states that MC says that he was from another multiverse to others. that was the case before, but it was the reason why I'm rewriting this story. so you don't need to worry about it anymore.

2: This story was originally supposed to be just in the MCU, but I decided to make it happen in the normal Marvel.

3: love interest: in case you didn't know, I didn't know if I should make this a harem or not before I wrote it. so I gave the choice to the readers.

And harem got more votes. so it became a small harem of two, Natasha and Wanda. but since this story would be pretty boring if it was just the movies, I changed it to the normal marvel.

BUT, you see, this story wasn't going to be THAT deep and complicated. It was just going to be a mcu movies universe, so I was okay with making it a harem of two. But now that the story is in the real marvel universe, there are a lot of pretty girls. So I have been thinking about it and having headaches about it. If I make it like that and have the mc get all the beauties, it would be just like any other story with mc taking girls like they are pokemons.

And so, I decided that this story is a sole love interest with Natasha as the love interest. Cause you see, the reason why I made the mc a Symbiote, wasn't just about them being cool. They were unique, like no other. They aren't the strongest race there is, like Kryptonians or Saiyans. But they have one unique trait that made me love them and want one even if it could drive me crazy.

A Symbiote isn't just a powerful alien, it is a partner. A best friend that you can trust with all your heart and mind. A being that is just for you, a bond that is just with you two. A being that will stick with you through thick and thin. Making this a harem, will take away the reason why I love the symbiote race.

4: MC will sleep and fuck other girls, but he won't get into any relationships with them like Ghost Spider (Gwen Stacy), Black Cat (Felicia Hardy), Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff), etc. Natasha will be okay with it because she will also fuck them like a guy since Ali can make a dick for her. So it will basically be double penetration.

Ali and Natasha will also NTR some people and fuck their wives or girlfriends, like Invisible Woman (Susan ""Sue"" Storm), Jean Grey (Phoenix), etc.",142.0,53.0,0,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/23871034106159805?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1676151515460

24412890705241405,MMORPG : Rebirth Of The Strongest Vampire God,Games,Raj_Shah_7152,"In the year 2100 humanity was introduced to the revolutionary full dive VR game called 'Omega', however, the game was not a technology made by humans but one granted to humanity by a higher power to prepare them for the first awakening.

It was only a tutorial and a means to smoothly transition the primitive species from thinking that they were alone in the entire universe, to being integrated into the true wide universe.

When the average user level in the game exceeded the predetermined threshold the tutorial finally ended and planet earth underwent a catastrophic event called the 'First Awakening ', as mana started to flow freely in the real world as it did in the virtual world and the real universal stage game called 'Sigma' was unveiled.

'Sigma' was governed by the omnipotent A.I. the universal queen, and was the grand stage where races from all across the universe fought together for territory, resources, and honor.

Set in a universe where fantasy races such as elves, dragons, and vampires are not a myth but real power players, humans quickly found out that they were one of the weakest races to play 'Sigma'.

In such desperate times, humans turned to their best professional players for salvation.

--------------

Max, was a genius in the world of Omega and deemed the hope of mankind after the first awakening. However, an accident crippled his mana veins and caused him to be assessed as a manaless trash in Sigma!

Deemed hopeless and irredeemable, he quickly went from hero to zero, and the world ignored him.

For ten years since the first awakening, he lived the life of a manaless trash and became a bottom feeder in society, slowly losing his pride, his possessions, and eventually his identity.

In the end, he faced a tragic and painful death while failing to save his young nephew and niece from assailants.

However, it was not the end of Max's story but just the beginning as he was reincarnated back in time to the day before the first awakening before his downfall started!

Armed with the knowledge of the future, watch as Max reaches for the apex in his second life and fights against his destiny with grit and tenacity.

Right before one of her kneecaps was about to land on the ground, Fu Hang still thought that Shen Yan would admit to her mistake. Little did he expect Shen Yan to slowly straighten up and said, ""Fu Hang, let's divorce. I'll just pretend that I fed the past three years to the dogs.

Good and Evil.
Dark Lord of the Sith.
Savior of the Republic.
Hero of the Mandalorian War.
Traitor of the Jedi.
He has been called many things, and after the Star Forge's destruction, his story was meant to end.

But what happens if the Force isn't done with him?

Revan and crew have set the Star Forge on a path of destruction. But when the shockwave from the exploding factory reaches them as they jump to hyperspace, they will discover that the Force has one last surprise in store for them.

(I've always believed Revan to be Chaotic Neutral. And that is how I plan to write him as. Sometimes good, sometimes evil. I will be going by game lore for him.)
(It's kind of slow, so I'm told. Action isn't the main focus, because Revan and crew are NOT dedicated murder-hobos.)

Inspired by Zevren: ""Wrath of the Force""
Motivated by ObsidianRain: ""Spartan in Star Wars""
I obviously do not own the Star Wars franchise.

She died at the hands of her psycho brother in her first life. But luckily, she charmed her ""big brother"" this time. Her father remains a sc*mbag, though.

But a blessing in disguise happened when her twin brother got ""sick."" Because of that, she has to pretend as the ""Crown Prince,"" forcing her father to treat her well.

She thought she was finally on the road to becoming a lady of leisure.

But, despite her laziness, she still ends up completing royal duties that put her closer to the throne than her sick twin brother. The next thing she knew, they already prophesied her to be the first empress of their very patriarchal empire.

Now Neoma finds herself in the middle of the succession war she never wanted to be involved in!

***
[EXCERPT 1]
“Neoma de Moonasterio, the first princess of Moonasterion Empire. From now on, you’ll live as Prince Nero’s proxy.”
[The hell is this psycho saying?]
Neoma, despite her confusion, still smiled at her father--- the emperor. “Father, what do you mean by that?”
“From now on, assassins sent by my enemies would target Nero,” the emperor explained. “Until he’s strong enough to protect himself, you’ll pose as your twin brother.”
Her smile froze, but she still acted innocent. “But Father. If I take my brother’s position, then wouldn’t the assassins mistake me for him and…”
She stopped talking when she realized that was exactly what the emperor wanted her to do.
[This sc*mbag wants me to be bait?!]
“You’re no longer a princess, Neoma de Moonasterio. From now on, you’ll live as Prince Nero de Moonasterio,” Emperor Nikolai said coldly while looking down at her with glowing red eyes. “Try to survive until your twin brother comes back to take his rightful place, understood?”
Neoma was too shocked to react.
[Are you f*cking kidding me, you sc*mbag?!]

“What will you do about it then?” Nikolai asked with a smirk. “Kill me?”
“Yes! I’ll f*cking kill you, sc*mbag!”
“Language,” he warned her, upset that his five-year-old daughter curses like a sailor. “Using vulgar words is unbecoming of the future Crown Prince.”
“I’m a princess!”
Upon yelling those words, the royal princess’s eye color changed from ash-gray to red.
[This is getting serious.]
“Stop it, Nero,” Nikolai told her sternly. “If you keep that up, the royal knights will come and–”
“I’m not Nero!” Neoma screeched angrily. Then she jumped in the air with her left fist, ready to punch him. “In the name of the moon, I’ll punish you!”

Maybe even thought of as a breeding mare. The fact that he was engaged already spoke volumes upon volumes regarding that.
But,
It wasn't as if all hope was lost. Yes he was slightly crippled and no type of healing worked but, had anyone sought to understand why it was so? If they did, did they ever succeed?
The truth of it was, they didn't.
Roman had died before and reincarnated, passed through the origin of all creation, the Root, retaining a self. Some part of his soul was sapped hence the dysfunctions but he'd gained much for it, a power that may shake the very world given time to truly manifest.
Question was, what would he do with it?

Excerpt:

""Why can’t I let you go even when you’re not even mine.” He said against her neck between kisses, his hot breath making her skin shudder.

“R-Rhys..we can’t.” she stuttered with a flush on her face.

Rhys chuckled, it was low and slightly menacing.

“I know little mouse, I know.”

Want to know why did he realize he was reincarnated?
He still keeps all his memories of all the novels, fanfics, manga, and manhwa that he read, even the anime and Marvel movies are still in his mind so that they have become very clear because his mind is empty of everything else other than them.

Suddenly he heard a mechanical sound in his mind, making his mind blank.

{There's a really huge harem here, so if that's not your interest just don't read on}

--------------------------------------------------

This is my second book, I only write for fun, and practice for my original novel, but I intend to keep working hard to the end if the audience likes it.

*Reminder*

This is an alternate world, everything that happens in this story has absolutely nothing to do with the original stories.

Chapters will be daily, average words per class: 2000, no matter what characters I create, the rest is the property of the owners.

The new cover is not mine, I just added some little tweaks like MC's Jolly Roger, if you don't like it you can change it.

I don't own (one piece) nor its main characters, and I don't own all of the upcoming works, all I own is the hero and some of the few characters I will probably make.

The worlds I've chosen at yet are One Piece. Against The Gods. Fairy Tail. Tokyo Revengers. The Legendary Mechanic. Naruto. Akame Ga Kill. Nanatsu no Taizai. and Solo Leveling.

In her past life, Su Meng married Wei Ting, thinking that she could eventually win his heart with tolerance and flattery. For this, she tried to flatter Wei Ting’s sister, Wei Xue, as well. Wei Xue said, “Wei Ting doesn’t like girls who wear makeup.” So Su Meng was as bland as a maid, but Wei Xue was exquisite as a princess every day. Wei Xue said, “Wei Ting loves to drink milk.” So Su Meng prepared a glass of milk for Wei Ting every day, but he never drank it. Wei Xue said, “Wei Ting likes fresh flowers.” So Su Meng would fill the house with fresh flowers on each of Wei Ting’s birthdays. Alas, Wei Ting would turn and leave every time, and Su Meng had never celebrated his birthday with him ever since they got married.

One day, Wei Xue said, “I killed your child on behalf of Brother Wei Ting. Why don’t I send you to hell now so you can keep your child company? Oh, I forgot to tell you that I was adopted by the Wei family. I have no blood relation to Brother Wei Ting. I love him, and he loves me.”

Su Meng died, and when she woke up again, she found herself having returned to that night, five years ago. This night, she was supposed to get pregnant with Wei Ting’s child. Staring at Wei Ting, the obedience and flattery in her expression disappeared without a trace. What remained was only icy resentment. “Get out!” Wei Ting felt incredulous. This woman was seducing him in the first place, so why did she suddenly turn into a stranger? The next day, Wei Xue appeared before Su Meng with her fake smile. However, after experiencing all that, Su Meng couldn’t possibly let herself be tricked again! In this life, Su Meng would live for herself and take revenge for her child and herself! Men? Beat it!

The world will tremble under the reign of the Lord of Fire as he reclaims his legacy and unleashes his fury upon those who betrayed his family.

24848059306243305,Yu-Gi-Oh GX: Meta Player,Anime & Comics,That_One_Dead_Ali,"I died, I met an Omnipotent being, and he granted me some wishes. Pretty cliche at this point, right? Can't get any originals in these times, am I right? But that's where the cliches stop. Why? Well, what do you think my wish was? To be overpowered? To have a massive, useless harem? No, god no. I hate harems, damn it! (Ahem ahem, but some worlds are exceptions.) So what was my wish?

Pretty original, I wanted to be a Multiverse myself! Not as in own a Multiverse. But as in be a literal Multiverse myself! Pretty cool, right? But what kind of Multiverse did I become? Simple, I became a Parasitic Multiverse, where I would send pieces of myself to different Multiverses and copy their sources of powers and such to make myself even stronger than them!

Comics like Marvel, DC, Invincible, movies like Transformers, Godzilla, Harry Potter, cartoons like Rick and Morty, TMNT, Kung Fu Panda, animes like Dragon Ball, Bleach, Naruto, and games like God of War, Assassin's Creed, Devil May Cry! I want them all, I want every power available in each and every one of them! So I sent my soul pieces to every one of them!

But not as overpowered beings. Nah, that would be boring. I don't want to just copy their powers, I want to experience and venture around too! So what about this soul piece? What's it going to do, and what Multiverse will it go to? Doesn't the damn title make it obvious?!

This is the tale of my soul piece going to the Yu-Gi-Oh GX (yugioh GX) to become the king of games, and bring the horror and disgust of the Meta and Rogue Decks of his timeline to these poor souls! Watch as he brings them all down with 50 minute (hour, really) combos and makes them regret dueling!

A smooth sailing second life of Athan starts with something mystical inside his body and other benefits of it that could make him stronger with some suffering. However...he didn't know that due to his soul ( That was supposed to return to the source of the universe after death but instead, it transmigrated by someone for some purpose and that caused an adverse effect like increasing misfortune on his soul ) The benefits he receives ultimately becomes the source of his second doom that is even worse than death. But...that's when the future Void emperor is born.

+short synopsis:
A young boy, raised in an irregular environment, find the reality he live in is more than he ever knew, or thought it is, and from that point the journey of his life begins, as he's moving in&out of different paths, in his way of finding his own way of life, purpose, goals, and place.

+short plot synopsis:
Through obtaining power(s), some intentionally and some directed to him, the MC begins exploring life, and confront issues of health, wealth, urges, desires, purpose, relationships, and more.

+Alert! :
This story is a WISH-FULFILLMENT. what does it mean? of course a happy end, and even if the journey he's on will be turbulent, no tragedy will happens to him, at least not permanent (so no plot-armor, as he does have his harsh-moments, like the risk of death, or not easily getting women like he's picking fruits from a tree ... BUT, he will win, everything)

P.S: Reviewing my writing, this story is a slow-burn till ch.10, but by ch.15 the story is up-to-speed, gets lighter, more fresh, and I'd bet you'd like it. Each volume is like a book of it own, so be aware of it + It's my first novel, and I do think the quality of it gets better each volume, showing the 'true colors' in vol.06+07.

+There's lots of pics (9,000+), which I find important, all over the chapters, as this is part of the fan-fic for me as well, the art (meaning, if you read from a phone-web-browser, not seeing comments, you miss a serious parts, imo) [around 20+ avg. pics each ch, and much more as farther you go] {Look at Author'-comment-history, it's all this novel pic-uploads, but it diverse a lot, as after few thousands, I diverse the style a lot, including irls, gifs, look alikes, etc}.

---
[Q&A]:
chapter length = 3,000+ words; [each Vol = 100k words] ;
what R-18? = romance, lots of 'fun', no ntr; [Bit yuri-tease, disappears through the middle as readers seems repulsed by it];
how's MC? = weak-to-strong, op-route; [Bit childish in first volumes, but the growth-sprout in later volumes is imo amazing];
what Fanfic? = (by relevance) One piece, Soul land, DBZ, DXD, Food wars!, ... ;
---

[My first novel, btw, and will be free (I do think farther ch, like Vol.06+, has qualities everyone can find enchanting, so yeah, first novel series, and somehow felt, plus each Vol is like a book on it own) + I'm not the owner of those fanfics,pics,etc, I use, but I do find using those characters, plots, and background as fulfilling. It's mostly based upon, and the fic-plots is synced into this story plot (by heroines you can probably guess when). You don't need to read more than short-synopsis of the used novels, but if you do, than it's like the hidden sides of this, and those, novels (like o.p. hidden-secrets-theories, etc, yet will take only a small space, but I think if you know the plots you'll like it)].

(After reading so many novels, the feeling of a missing piece, an important one, sent me to write this story. I'm maybe the writer, but I sure am this novel most avid reader & I hope you'll find it enjoyable too).

P.S: Read the 'Warning' episode. It has more details, who're probably needed if you try to decide if to read this novel (&there's 'chapters short narration' chapter, who can sum-up what's going on in this novel in each chapter, so ctrl+f there if you have a question about chars)",207.0,227.0,4,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/23848304605738905?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1660651419241

News! Please Read before reading!!*

If you found this fiction lacking in quality or want to see something done differently, I'm remaking this fanfic to add more to the story, as well as visit other worlds and anime, I'm taking suggestions of worlds to visit, so instead of going the same exact route with a dialogue change, I want to visit worlds like Demon Slayer, or Reincarnated as a Smile, or MCU, or DC, or any other worlds you feel are interesting and will add a sense of freshness to this already finished and outdated fiction. I'm doing this to make a better fiction as well as to try and get more inspiration to create new fictions, so come with me on this journey one more time, as I hope to make it longer and more encompassing, as well as add more detail as I am noticing while going through the early chapters I rushed quite a lot of the story just to get to parts I enjoyed while watching the Anime's. Give me your thoughts, I might even go to the Rick and Morty universe to grab some of Rick's tech and blow some shit up. Also, I don't want to limit the Harem this time, but I also don't want to just catch em all to have a bunch of onaholes, I want to build proper character relationships, so look forward to more than just r18 scenes with the women being silent and out of the picture the rest of the time.",197.0,222.0,0,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/14810085905697005?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1568143269445

In the far future, the galactic human civilization has entered the Age of Mechs. The countless lesser powers of humanity have come to adopt mechs as their main weapons of war.

Only a small number of humans have the right genetic aptitude to pilot these destructive war machines the size of buildings.

Born to a military family in the edge of the galaxy, Ves Larkinson is one of the many people who lacks the talent to earn glory in battle. Instead, he became a mech designer. Helped by his missing father, Ves has obtained the mysterious Mech Designer System that can help him rise in the galaxy and beyond.

His mechs based on the principles of life quickly allows him to rise to prominence. Powerful and highly compatible with mech pilots, his products have the potential to take the market by storm. However, success does not come easily, and countless challenges bar his ability to sell his mechs to a market eager for innovation!

With the sins of the human race in the galactic arena slowly catching up, Ves must navigate the perils of the ultra-competitive mech market and maintain control over his growing organization of misfits.

This is the golden age of mechs. This is the golden age of humanity. The question is, will it last?

Thank you if you do.


Synopsis:
The Supreme General of the Hevsue empire, Eseryt, the most powerful empire on earth was killed in battle after falling into a trap made by the combined countries.

He was given top priority over everything else to be killed as he was the Hevsue empire's most powerful soldier even considered its backbone.

With power like that of a god borne on earth over 10,000 enemy soldiers fall at his feet every month, they had tried to kill him many times in the past but he always came out on top.

It was as though he possessed no weaknesses to speak of.

Unfortunately for him he does indeed have one such weakness......his own empire.

Sometimes following orders from above without a second thought and often times foregoing to question their loyalty.

In this small failure he was set up by some corrupt officials of the empire who though the empire was done for, as all other countries formed an alliance to deal with their own Supreme General.

But he knew best not everything ever goes as planned, opportunities exist in everything, even death....

The story will follow canon for the initial part with a new plot. Major changes will reflect in the later part as our MC grows up. The story has strong AU elements and the power scaling is ramped up to explore various foreign elements in Naruto. Everything in its entirety will be a part of the Naruto series with details and speculations of my own.
This story is my original creation, and I post it on Scribble hub and Webnovel. You might find a few initial chapters on Royal Road.
Note:- The starting 40 chapters or so have poor grammar and various mistakes since I was a new writer back then and lacked experience. But I am working on editing them.

21221629505634605,Vile Evil Hides Under The Veil,Fantasy,Grayback,"Meet Eren Elijhah Idril, the guy who just couldn't catch a break even in the afterlife. He kicks the bucket as an old, broke-down adventurer, courtesy of a not-so-friendly neighborhood monster.

Bummer, right? But hold onto your hats, 'cause that's not where his story ends.

By some crazy stroke of fate, Eren gets thrown back in time to his teenage years, back when he was just a greenhorn at Lionheart Academy, dreaming big and not a care in the world (except maybe passing his special exams as a a novice Ranker).

Now, most folks might use a second shot at life to right their wrongs, make amends, you know, the whole shebang. But not our boy Eren. Nope, he's not about to let a little thing like mortality slow him down. With a fresh start on the horizon, Eren decides to throw caution to the wind and embrace his inner rogue.

And boy, does he embrace it. From pulling off daring heists to stirring up trouble wherever he goes, Eren dives headfirst into a life of mischief and mayhem, all without batting an eyelash. No hesitation, no regrets—just pure, unadulterated chaos.

After years of intense conflicts between his guild, Hellscape, and the guild of his former infidel lover, Darkrow, things came to a head when Draco conquered all.

Now, nothing stood in his way of total conquest within the highly acclaimed second world of mankind, as he intended to fortify his new empire.

Unfortunately, a timely assassination sent him back into the wheel of time for reincarnation, but not even the Gods gave him peace of death.

Thrust into the past, Draco realized he'd been given a second chance at life to start from scratch, with all the knowledge of over fifteen years of almost absolute power in Boundless.

Now, his path to glory will be far shorter and filled with more bloodshed than Hades could handle.

[Synopsis]

Noah's story started in a pretty cliche way. He died foolishly because he didn't mind his own damn business or maybe he was just unlucky. Anyway, Noah meets a goddess claiming to be an apex existence in the Omniverse and gets them 3 wishes as per the usual script.


His journey then starts from there henceforth as he effortlessly transcends his existence while traversing the Omni-Realities!


And on the way, he would probably not forget to woo beautiful women!

His predecessor got experimented on by humans.
Now he Awakens as Darkseid's strongest mutant ever seen or will be seen in Marvel Omniverse.

Mc is as strong as Darkseid Avatars, not the true form of Darkseid, and Mc also inherits Darkseid's will or consciousness or essence.

So he got his hunger for Power, Destruction, and conquest with a lust to collect a good specimen of the females no matter the species. And he also got the memories of his body past self go went through Gruesome experiments by Humans to awaken his X-Gene.

a task and his life on the line, he decided to say ""fuck it!"" and do whatever was necessary for him to survive, and get the girls there no low to low for him. And what are expecting he Is DARKSEID.


He was in Marvel, and the women were non-other than the girlfriends, partners, or wives of the characters he knew.

To top it off, he doesn't want to mind control them or force his way in them no.

So, will he take the girls for himself or will he die trying?


So you can imagine there is No humanity left in him and Mc was himself no good man when he got transmigrated.



It's a Pure Evil Mc is pure evil so dont expect him to do good and even if did he has alternate motives behind it.



As for Harem for not pure love but for power and having females his, it looks like you never heard the line ""AS THE UNIVERSE INFINITELY EXPANDS SO TO DOES THE HAREM"" so it's going to be Big, Bigger, Biggest, and more

Some warnings so I can save you time: Yes, Incest. Yes, Harem. If you don't like it, I'm sorry to waste your time.

Billy was already satisfied enough that he retained his memories, but the surprises didn't end there. He was born with a weird power that granted him the chance to convert mana into experience points and transmit it to all sorts of things.

Things were looking pretty good until he noticed that he was born in an impoverished and rustic village that was facing their imminent extinction in the hands of creatures that he had never heard of before and other tribes that had all sorts of abilities. Before he could learn how even to crawl, Billy had to find a way to help his tribe. Otherwise, they will be annihilated before he can even become strong enough to stand.

Much farther away from Earth than he had originally thought, Billy will have to adapt to a new environment where his tribe is at the bottom of the food chain. Will he be able to grow up safely and try to change things for the better for his new family and friends?

Touted as a universal cure, people had elevated his status above the norm and given him the classification ""Panacea"". In the media, he was hailed as a great hero who would usher in a new era or human wellness. However, behind the scenes things weren't so bright. Being a unique individual, Vahn spent his entire youth locked up in a lab with various scientists and research teams using his body and blood to perform endless amounts of experiments. The only solace in his suffering was the various anime and manga made available to him between experiments. He often imagined himself as the protagonist in a world of his own, finally in control of his own destiny. For years he nurtured this desire, until at the age of 14 he died when an organization had tried to kidnap him from the lab...

""Finally, I don't have to suffer anymore...""

This supporting character was a country bumpkin who couldn’t get married due to her obesity. According to the original script, this country girl Qiao Mei was a fatty spoiled by her grandfather. However, their relatives were all vicious and cruel people. Her grandfather had poor health, so once he died, the relatives would divide and swallow up his assets. Hence, her grandfather’s greatest wish was to marry Qiao Mei off. For this, even sacrificed and betrayed his good friend’s grandson, Xia Zhe. Grandpa got Xia Zhe drunk and had Qiao Mei forcibly take the strong and handsome Xia Zhe with her body which weighed more than two hundred pounds. Then, grandpa would catch them the next day and force Xia Zhe to marry Qiao Mei. However, that eventually caused the start of Qiao Mei’s unfortunate life.

Also, in the original story, Qiao Mei took possession of Xia Zhe’s mysterious jade. But due to Qiao Mei’s stupidity, her cousin's sister had tricked Qiao Mei into giving her the jade, which resulted in the cousin’s family becoming rich.

She woke up groggily the next day and grandpa’s team had already appeared at the door. Qiao Mei was frightened. She didn’t want to proceed on the original path and marry a man who didn’t love her. And so, she lied and chased grandpa away. She also pushed the man out before forcing herself to look at her tanned and chubby reflection in the mirror! Alas, she cried at her ugly appearance…

Rumors had it that she rescued the Jiang family's madame many years ago in the countryside. After she enrolled at Sea City University, the madame took her to the Jiang family's residence before school started, claiming to familiarize the lady with Sea City's environment.

It was said that that the young lady was an orphan who grew up in the countryside. However, she carried herself in a manner that befitted a rich young lady from a prestigious family, more so than the real rich young ladies.

It was said that the young lady had not seen the world and was not presentable. However, she maintained her composure in front of the bigshots from all walks of life. She maintained a proper smile that made people look askance.

It was said that the young lady was brought home by Old Madame Jiang to be Young Master Jiang's wife.

It was said that the young lady came from too humble a background and was not fit to marry into the Jiang family.

It was said that the young lady fell in love with the young master of the Jiang family at first sight, but the young master of the Jiang family did not care about her at all.

…

First meeting.

She sat by the lotus pond in the Jiang family mansion as she read a book.

Even though she was in a simple outfit of a white T-shirt matched with black pants, he saw the charm of a beautiful lady.

She exuded the aura of a young lady.

First meeting.

Her book fell. He called after her.

She turned around after hearing him.

At that moment, she suddenly understood what ""a man as beautiful as jade"" meant.

He was a bright gentleman who was as gentle and beautiful as jade; she was an elegant young lady, reserved and upright.

If someone asked her what her greatest gain in coming to Sea City was, she would answer without hesitation, ""Meeting him.""

17460195006101205,The Rise Of A Porter,Fantasy,AkshatArpit,"Do read my new novel **Chimaera's Conquest**.
It would mean a lot to me if you could read it and give your valuable review. Thanks in advance.

****
The novel follows the story of Arnold, a porter, who accompanies warriors and superhumans inside dangerous dungeons, which are distinguished by their colours. The porters were always mistreated by the modern human civilization and even though their job was riskier than that of warriors and superhumans, their existence was never appreciated nor were they paid well.

No one knows why these dungeons started to appear all over the world. The only thing they know was the dangers that would find their way into the world if they didn't kill the monsters. But only a selected few cared about the calamity because for the rest it was all about earning money and gaining power.

But nothing in this new world is constant and everything keeps changing, and this time the change would find its way towards an ordinary Porter.

After stealing a scroll from the dungeon, he ran off to his home. The scroll gave him powers no one could've imagined to gain. But he wasn't alone. 9 other humans had been granted similar powers... powers of the Gods!

What would Arnold do with his newfound powers? Will he kill the other 8 Paladins and rule over the world which had oppressed him for years? Or will he rise against the Gods and make them repent for their crimes?

Can the strength lent by the Gods be sufficient to deal with them once and for all? Would he be able to defeat his creator? Or will he join the Gods instead?

Too many questions, too little time. The decisions he would make could be the end of humanity Or would an ordinary Porter, become he world's only hope?

Follow me on the journey to the power of this ordinary Porter as he becomes the Savior or the Devil.

Warning:
There might be a few grammatical errors in the early chapters, so if you are a grammar nazI then please proceed with caution.

Also, the MC isn't very bright and will do a lot of stupid things from time to time. So if you like a cool and calculating MC you won't be seeing him like that until later chapters (Chapter 100 or so). I'm telling this to y'all here so you don't start yelling at me in the comments or review. All in all, I've tried to make the MC as realistic as I could.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you and enjoy reading my creation!

2. Harem: Zombie Girls, Normal Girls and Zombified Girls.(Any more variation wouldn’t make sense unless you guys really vote for it.)
3. System: A powerful God like system, which is not too broken but still very powerful. Level up and Evolution.

…………………
The plot will change by Volume each and basically each volume will have at least one of them:
Survival, Action, Fights, Kingdom Building, Training, Craft learning, Adventure missions, etc.
The Side-Characters will have their own specific goal, personality, background history, etc. That includes girls, friends, family and of course, Villains.
Face slapping will be there from time to time.
Even though I would focus on a light comedy setting with a lot of jokes of all types, I won’t hesitate to throw in dark moments from time to time. So be prepared for that as well. I like putting twists where people would least expect it, so there is that too.
The basic information about MC and his objective is in the review I pinned so look it up.

Having lost their home planet and in search of a new one, the Earth was the next habitable planet for them.

Humans and Slarkovs made a deal with each other in return for the Slarkovs living on Earth.

They were similar to humans except for some of them who had slight differences, so fitting into society wasn't a problem.

////

I've read a lot of fanfictions on a lot of anime and what they all have in common is that you'd hardly find one that goes ways back. For example, most Naruto fanfiction I've read only features either Minato's generation, Kalashi's generation Itachi's, or Naruto's you'd rarely see anyone about Jiraiya, Tsunade, and Orochimaru's generation not to talk of Madara and Hashirama.

I've always been fascinated by the ancient times of almost all anime that has an ancient past. DXD, DC, Marvel, One Piece, Bleach, Tensura, and many more.

With this in mind, I decided to write a story from way back in the era of Indra and Ashura.

There will be skills from different animes and mangas, just to let you know.

The volume two would have lots of characteristics from Cultivation worlds ways of writing.

So please, read at your own discretion. Every ability or theory I come up with is what it is. Deal with it like that or don't bother reading at all.

Constructive Criticism is very much encouraged however.

This is my first novel guys and I don't own the basic principles in the novel. I either borrow or come up with a different one altogether.

I'm just translating this novel based on the link I gave below for at least a few chapters , After that I'll continue the rest of the novel story from a complete different fanfic from this one,maybe a mixture of a few as some world travel fanfics doesn't focus on Romance, While some just focus on getting girls, while some doesn't have a decent ending.

So I'll just say this Fanfic focuses both on Romance and Powering up.
Mc will travel to different worlds with his real body and the time difference between the wolds is based on how powerful that world is.


I'll also continue translating Douluo one .
I will also write some R18 chaps as you know how they are in Chinese novels.

Though I've written it before but I'll say again that I'm not a native English speaker so it'll not be a fanfic with perfect translation but it is somewhat ok.

// Well, to begin with, this will be the first story I do so I hope you like it, although I only do it because I found the idea of doing whatever you want in a fantasy world interesting and the idea of reincarnation is something interesting as well. Like the idea of traveling to other worlds, if you have any suggestions or something you want to add, comment as well as how fortunate you got here in the first place so thank you.//

// The protagonist is good and bad, you could say his personality is changeable and somewhat strange, as he does bad things, he also does not know the reason why he does them but he does not like the idea that others do them, he thinks that only He has the right to do them, it seems wrong for others to do them, but if he does them, he does not care as well as he does not mind manipulating people or changing people in his favor or taste no matter who he is or because it is his love, If you can do it quickly, that's fine, but you will also take your time to do other things and also to take action in other places and events in the world.//

Joining the military in the hope of helping exterminate the Supernaturals from an early age, he found out that it's impossible to kill the Werewolf that was responsible for killing his parents without being an Awakened.

On a fateful night, in a near-death experience, he's given a chance by the full moon.

It was the turning point of his life. Obtaining a System that allows him to become stronger, having the potential to match and surpass the Supernaturals, Rex was ecstatic until he saw his stats window.

""I'M NOT A WEREWOLF!!""

""Daily quest failed, sanity stat has been decreased by 20%!""

""Sanity stat is too low, you are unable to contain the blood moon blessing!""

""Starting forceful transformation!""

""WHAT?! I'm a human! What transformation?!""

""You are overwhelmed with bloodlust!""

He recreated the series based on his memory and designed the Zombie Apocalypse series. Unfortunately, at this point, everyone was persuading him to switch jobs. Even his girlfriend broke up with him.

This Fanfiction is something I have played around with for a very long time. In my head at least and I want to write some stuff about star wars. This is a wish fulfillment and I don't expect that to get through some of the thick skulls of readers.

I won't be updating this regularly, and I wont be giving it a schedule. It's just something I'll write and update when I feel like it. This story isn't set in the skywalker saga, I don't want to get within a light year of that radioactive waste dump. While the original trilogy, clone wars, and mandolorian were excellent that's where the list ends.

I don't want people writing reviews for this story, but I won't say you cant. I just want people to read a star wars fanfiction that is better then most out there. I wont lie I'm inspired by A New Player In The Force. However, my story wont be anything like that fanfiction though I really suggest you people read it. Its actually written by an educated teacher whos fighting leukemia.

Im sorry if you liked the Original but i didnt as much after looking back on it after making plenty of other stories since then so i decided to restart this one all over again.

you can read the original Synopsis on the original one but short of it is Dio woke up 60 Years earlier than cannon and somehow got a Smartphone to make him part of this Chat Group. though this time this is completely DIO and not him merged with someone else this time so he knows his own plot being a major difference and some of the original chat group members will change as well with only a few staying from the original one.

This is a complete Restart so this will go differently than before, hopefully.

Then from nowhere, that ungrateful sockethole, Somanda tries to END me! Can you believe that?!

I mean, I have told some questionable stories about him caressing my skull affectionately and deeming me his prized undead, but no need to axe a skeleton for something like that, right?

RIGHT?!

I managed to escape through one of the most convenient and contrived get-aways in all of undead history, even managing to pull a bony one on the Lich bastard by stealing two of his seemingly important possessions which I find out later to be better than I thought they’d be!

From there it’s a just a SPIRAL of boneshit left and right! I can’t catch a break! What’s with this atrocious luck, bro?!

A voice speaks to me about how I have qualified for something about a something that’s supposedly something’s something!

Powerful beasts and men are at every turn, all lining up to be a huge pain in my PELVIS!

GAAAAH!

Jeez this is happening too fast!

However, even while I’m in the thick of this, the one saving grace is that I got something worth while!

A new path of power!

I can NOT be an undead!

I can be something better than both the Living and the Dead!

Immune to the antics from both sides. Well... most of them!

I’m no longer on the path for Undeath!

Only Lifelessness awaits me!

I’m the one who transcends reality in this tale!

I am... SKULLIUS!

[Author’s Answers To Popular Readers’ Questions]

Q: (IHateArjuun77) -Hey author, is your book trash?-

A: (Author) -Haha, screw you dear reader. The answer is NO. The story has elements of comedy, action, magic, adventure and Brutality. Like it gets really dark sometimes. There’s a comprehensive story with characters that I tried my damndest to NOT make generic on top of a cool power system that’s for the most part easy to understand. So its not trash.

Q: (IFreakingHateArjuun56) -Hey author why is your first volume so slow paced and... trash?-

A: (Author) -Haha. It’s how I designed the First Volume to be. It’s a fun setup that doesn’t focus on many things other than the MC’s mentality, powers and route of progression. The next volumes are normal paced, focusing on the world, the villains and general expansion but all while still retaining the book theme and fun experience-

Q: (ShadeIsAPervert001) -Hey author, I instinctively sense that I’ll hate this book, when should I drop?

A: (Author) -Is this the same reader?! Anyway, I’ll give a range. Read a minimum of the first 20 chapters to a max of up to chapter 44 before you decide on anything too rash. I’ll hunt down this reader!

Served in the army during WW2, he took place in many battles. He wasn't particularly strong or even incredibly skilled with guns. For the longest time he didn't know why he lived, when so many friends of his died.

At the Omaha Beach, he saw so many of his fellow soldiers cut down by enemy fire and explosions.

During his time out of the army, many of his fellow soldiers had died from their debilitating injuries.

He found out though. He survived, not due to his skills or strength, but because of his unstoppable will and madness.

He hadn't cared for his life since he was a young boy. Father leaving him with a sick Mother. He took any job a child could do but in the end, his Mother still died. Trying to move on with his life, he fell in love eventually. But she too was killed during their trip to Hawaii when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He joined the army, not out of patriotism, but hate. His spite for the world grew like a fire from that day on. Hoping for himself to die in the war, he never got his wish.

The years went on but still, his spite never left him. It wasn't until the year 2010 at the tender age of 95 that he finally saw his foolishness. All that bitterness and hate he carried made him miserable. Life was unfair, but one should never give up on the smallest chance to be happy.

In his retirement home he began to make friends with the other residents. Finding hobbies and talking with them.

Eventually, he got into anime. It was introduced by one of his friend's Grandsons when he visited. He used the time he had left to indulge in the shows made by the Country he loathed until just recently.

He spent the rest of his days comfortably, waiting to be reunited with his Lover once again when he finally passed on in 2018.

A few notes before you read this Fanfic.
It's not going to be a rushed story. It's going to take time and go through things slowly.
One Piece world only, no world traveling.
While the Main Character will be strong, he will not be OP for quite a while. Be prepared to wait for it.
The story will be following Luffy and the others for a while. This is for two reasons, one it helps me write and two, the Main Character actually has a valid motivation for doing so.
No harem.
Yes, the System is loosely based on 'The Gamer' but isn't a direct copy and is modified to suit my needs for my story. So while it might seem similar it is NOT the same.

I do not own One Piece or any of the characters. All rights belong to their respective owners. I only own the Original Character.
