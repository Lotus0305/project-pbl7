“Are you mating with someone?”
Stunned, she took a step back, widening the space between them. “ Excuse me?”
“Ah…” A sigh left his lips. “ Perhaps, I need to rephrase my question. Are you f*cking someone?”
She sucked in a quick breath, not knowing what to say. Anger reared itself in her head, mixing with unexpected desire. Sadly, desire was winning.
He lifted an eyebrow, and in the next instant, he was already standing in front of her body. Her instincts kicked in. She took a couple steps back until her back hit the wall.
The smell of chocolates and almonds rolled between them. Entranced, she thought she smelled the sweetness of the wine but it disappeared as quickly as it came.
“I don’t think that is any of your business, Mr. Graydon.” she made a sound of annoyance.
“Is it not?” His breath fractured, his eyes darkened with desire.
“No.” Her lips quivered at her obvious denial. She mustered all the courage she could, hoping he wouldn’t smell her arousal. She knew it was for naught.
His fingers lightly brushed her cheeks, then they trailed down her neck, lingering on her collarbone, the contact sent shivers down her spine. It awakened the primal need she had been wanting to hide since they met.
She wanted him.
No.
She needed him, inside her.
Her face flushed at the thought of him taking her, preferably right against these walls.
“You want me,” he stated. ““As much as I want you.”
Shocked by her own raw and potent yearning, she turned her head away.
“I don’t…”
“Shhh…” he silenced her with a finger. Then he inched closer, so close his long lashes brushed against her cheek. Her heart pounded like a drum against her chest, fast and hot in anticipation.
“Now tell me little one… do I need to get rid of someone before I make you beg me to let you come?”

Is love worth the chaos it brings?

But how could she ever have foreseen that the man she had happened to come across with does not play with just a small fire, but a whole inferno?

Excerpt:
""You going through this marriage with me might as well be like you digging your own grave. Because the moment you start to want more from me, I will divorce you. And the moment you break your promise and try to fight me… I will ruin you and break you apart completely. Mercilessly. You will regret ever meeting this devil tonight."" His threat was given in the same soft but cold voice.

But Elle did not even flinch. Her gaze never faltered either. This man was ruthless, and she knew that clearly. His eyes that moment promised nightmares and darkness without any promise of respite.
But no matter what he says now, it would still not change her decision. She truly had no other choice.

""I understand now…"" she said quietly, steeling herself. ""Since you don't trust that I will keep my word, how about we do this? You prepare the divorce documents beforehand now and I'll sign it. That way, once you decide to divorce me in the future, the papers would already have been signed and there would be no way I can trouble you about it. You would just need to send it to the lawyers and have it notarized.""

A heavy silence reigned before his quiet disbelieving laugh broke the silence.

""I'm at a loss for words, Princess Izabelle."" He looked wickedly amused. But then he started nodding in approval. ""Fine, princess. I will marry you.""

She waited for updates, wallow in those empty days during the author’s constant hiatuses, cry and laugh with the characters; it was already a part of her short life.

Cosette really wished that the novel would never end despite that she was terminally ill.

But after three years, The Devil’s Den finally came to an end. With a reader as invested as Cosette, she had mixed emotions about the ending. Not that the ending was disappointing, but what disheartened her was the ending of her favorite character; the villain Maxen Devilsin.

One year later, Cosette took her last breath only to wake up in the body of the stunning Cosette Blac; the villainess of the novel The Devil’s Den, her second favorite character after the villain.

Granted with the opportunity to live in the world of her favorite novel before the main story starts, Cosette had a plan.

That was to simp over the characters and save her favorite characters whilst hoping that the female and male lead still have their happy ending.

In a world that was already written and events that were expected to happen whether or not they wanted to, can Cosette change the course of their lives? Was overwriting the characters' fate could save them? Or would it just give them a much worse ending than what the author had given them?

His parents were on the Forbes’ List, he was the valedictorian of his graduating class at the top university in the country, and the icing on the cake was being voted ‘school grass’ four years in a row by his peers. And now, at just twenty-five, Yan Zheyun was the proud chairman and CEO of his very own tech company.

But what should have been the happiest day of his life turned into the worst when he heard a strange robotic voice while crossing the road for coffee, just because he couldn’t wait for his secretary to return from the photocopying room.

[BUG REPORT #193842347: OTHERWORLD SOUL DETECTED. INITIATING DEPORTATION SEQUENCE.]

And then he died. In a very boring, very run-of-the-mill car accident.

…except maybe he didn’t.

The first thing Yan Zheyun thought after he opened his eyes and found himself in a bedroom that looked like the set of one of those inner palace dramas was: Wow, coffee wasn’t worth it.

The second thing he thought after he realised he was now in a historical BL novel and had transmigrated into the body of a tragic beauty who was (about to be) used and abused by his multiple lovers was: I must have opened my eyes with the wrong technique, let me try again…nope, still here. Well. F**k.

Stuck in a foreign world and surrounded by crazy tops (respectively A.K.A ‘The Childhood Friend’, ‘The General’s Son’, ‘The Crown Prince’, ‘Some Other Prince’, ‘That Creepy Duke’ etc.), Yan Zheyun realised that his one day’s experience as CEO had not prepared him adequately for this new life of misery.

But he wasn’t the sort to give up without a fight so…Yan Zheyun resolutely made up his mind to stay away from the terrifying romantic plot line, try and write himself a new political plot line, and while at it, hug some big thighs, curry some favour with the powerful.

And in a dynastic monarchy, whose thighs would be a better choice for hugging than the emperor himself?

""If I see you again, I'll ravish your body while you bleed, Prince!""

Rosina, a woman haunted by a dark past, developed a dangerous obsession that led to a trail of blood and corpses. A predator that liked to enjoy her prey before taking their lives.

She has always despised the idea of having a mate until she was compelled to attend the annual mating season. Harboring a deep desire for freedom, she detested any association with royalty.

During the mating event, she encountered a mysterious man wearing a blood-red mask.

Draco was portrayed as a carefree Third Prince who sought only amusement and avoided the responsibilities that came with the crown.

However, his encounter with Rosina ignited a change within him. He realizes that in order to win her hand in marriage, he must become a King.

That transformation set Draco on a path of self-discovery and growth as he strived to prove himself worthy of Rosina's love.

Would their encounter change their fate or push them to ruin?

Volume 2:

""My duty is to find a nobleman to lead my Pack, but you conquered my heart, commoner.""

Felissa was responsible for searching for a mate worthy of status and fulfilling her duty as the only daughter of an Alpha, which led her to revolve her life to become a perfect future Luna of the Midnight pack.

She was known as gentle as a fragile flower, or so they thought. Behind her cheerful smile hid the darkness that wanted to ascend and take over her body. A personality born due to the use of magic.

As Felissa hunted for a noble mate to satisfy her parents. She met a commoner with two identities.

Vicenzo was a man living different lives to keep his mother safe from the abusive Pack. He was willing to sacrifice the mate bond to destroy the New Monarch as his task, but his heart slowly broke apart and yearned for his mate's touch.

Would they prioritize their duty or give in to what their body desired?""

Volume 3:

""I will accept you despite everything you have done, my dearest.""

Gastone lived in the human world as his punishment but was called back to the Werewolf realm by Rosina to find his mate. He didn't want one because of his living situation and pride as a fallen Prince.

Along the way, he saved a troubled woman named Lucia and brought her to the realm after begging him to save her.

That caused problems since Werewolves were myths to humans. With the help of Draco, Gastone and Lucia settled in a secluded place temporarily for security.

Lucia had escaped from the Orphanage that worked in the black market. She aimed to stop its business to save many girl's lives but failed after years of planning.

After meeting Gastone, she intended to use him to her advantage since she needed milk to survive the curse.

Would their love blossom after finding great differences between their races?

IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO NEW READERS! PLEASE READ!

My first few chapters' writing quality is very bad and lackluster but gets much better as the novel progresses!

Also, the first 5 chaps are kinda similar to vamp system but the story and settings differentiate after that into their own thing past that point! Hope you stick around! :)

Quick note! many people in the world are cruel and almost psychotic but there is a good narrative reason for that, it will be explained later on in the novel I promise! :D

Kevin hadn't expected this turn of event and he felt his heartbeat quicken. Axel's hands were warm and he could feel his huge erection against him, one thing was sure, it was that he didn't let him indifferent.

21389064705112305,Urban,CEO's Runaway Mate and Her Cubs,xiaohai_23,"It's hard to win when your competition is small, cute, and calls your (future) wife their mommy.

Lara spent six years doing odd jobs to sustain her five-year-old kids. She fled from her birth town after noticing some of her children's weird habits.
They growl when they fight, and their teeth can cut the skin like it's nothing. They prefer meat when it's cooked raw. They howl at the moon when they don't want to sleep.
However, they're her children.
She's been on the run ever since to protect them. She knows nothing about the stranger she met that day and whom she spent the night with. Even the details are blurry in her mind, except for that weird, compelling attraction that brought them together.
When she scores an interview at the most prestigious company in Norwich City, she thinks her life will turn for the better. Until she meets him again.

Nathaniel Woods, Alpha Nate, is the CEO of LY Corp. A fated night of six years ago, he found his true mate. Unfortunately, that woman fled after their passionate night, leaving no traces for him to follow.
A twist of fate makes them meet again, and he's settled on not letting her escape.
But this time, she's not alone. There are two pups with her, growling and fighting, firmly set on not letting him get to their mommy.

WARNINGS:
Possessive male lead and even more possessive little buns.
Slight misunderstandings, not too annoying (hopefully). The male lead is doting, but life is difficult with two jealous pups preventing him from wooing his (future) wife.
The story follows other characters along with the leads.
Smut content (signaled at the beginning with a warning).

Werewolves are a little different from usual, so please bear with my version of the trope ;)

If you can't stand too much cuteness, do not open this book.
If you're allergic to dog fur, stay further away. Characters here are wolves, but some of them grow ears and tail when they're excited (or claws when they feel threatened).

This book is dedicated to all the parents single-handedly raising their cubs

Ann took a deep breath and nudged the door a little more. Her chest felt like it would explode as she held her breath whilst the crack widened.

When it revealed her sister lying underneath her husband-to-be, her hands flew to her mouth to stifle the gasp of horror as her heart shattered instantly.

As Brad roared his release inside her sister, Ada turned her head towards the door with a smirk.

An icy chill descended over Ann as if a bucket of ice water had been thrown over her and she stood and stared, her eyes wide and mouth slightly open in disbelief.

Born and raised as a nameless shadow guard for his kingdom’s crown prince, his life’s purpose was to be used and discarded at the whims of his liege.

And his meaningless life ended when the gaze of a princess lingered on him for too long. The crown prince had him beheaded without a second thought, as if throwing out trash.

Transmigrating into the body of a baby girl, the nameless shadow finally had a name, a family, and a place to call her own. Throwing away his past, the shadow guard was now called ‘Emilia’, and walked on a new path to seek fulfillment.

It was not meant to be, however, as the girl whom she had loved with all her heart and soul ended up mercilessly plunging a dagger through Emilia's love-struck heart at the highest point in her life.

The crowd clamored at the ‘deserved death of the villainess’, and at that moment, the shadow could only wonder… why?

Why am I always the one to dedicate myself fully to someone, only to be thrown away like trash in the end?

And thus, as her soul floated away while cursing in resentment, ‘Emilia’ vowed to herself that in her next life she shall never be the one to fully dedicate herself.

Whatever she likes shall be held in her palm, and shall never escape!

The moment the vow was made, a self-proclaimed villainess system proposed to partner with her, to explore and conquer the worlds through their anchors—the heroes and heroines.

And by cultivating this energy, she shall one day go back. Back to the world she was born as ‘Emilia’ in, and face the so-called heroine once more.

The second time they meet, Emilia won’t be the one drowning in regret!

TL;DR: Not Shakespeare, not complex, but fun and easy to read. Come support!
As the translator, I've enjoyed translating this novel and I hope to bring the essence of what the author has tried to portray into the chapters you will read.
To sum it up in 3 words: Mechs! Explosions! Science!
To be perfectly honest, this novel is about your typically overpowered protagonist who does get looked down from time to time but always overcomes the odds with his own special power. He's abit more mature having grown up on his own and just a littttttttle bit dense.
Although it always ends up with him winning, it always happens in an interesting (subjective) and fun way that makes me enjoy reading this.
The novel has elements of lighthearted comedy from time to time and I do chuckle at how direct the humor is.
It's not as smart as say WMW nor does it weave an intricate story much like Ergen's novels. More importantly, its fun and it doesn't try to hide it.",,,18,4.12,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/7922313105002205?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1548475210895

The game's popularity skyrocketed with the introduction of the Real Money Trading (RMT) system, and professional players formed guilds and factions to increase their profits.

But this prosperity was short-lived, as players began to fuse with their avatars, gaining powerful abilities in the real world that tipped the balance of power and caused chaos.

Two years later, demons and monsters from inside the game invaded the real world, decimating over 90% of humanity.

The remaining survivors were left hiding in fear, unable to fight back against the invaders.

Zell was an average player who spent most of his life working overtime to make ends meet; although he inherited a wonderful house thanks to his parents, most of his wages went to the property tax and food bill.

He found solace in collecting beasts in the game and evolving them into humanoids, primarily females.

When the end came, he was powerless and alone, with only his pets and Rika, his cherished Flame Rabbit, as his companions.

In a final act of bravery, Zell saves the life of a strange girl with white wings, sacrificing himself.

But instead of dying, he awoke in an empty white room with a single computer and a game-like screen that allowed him to edit his IRL avatar and persona.

19246142306924705,Fantasy,Falling in Love with the King of Beasts,AimeeLynn,"[COMPLETE] Reth stalked towards her, chin low so the shadow cast by his hard jaw cut across the thick fur collar of his vest. His hair had fallen over his eyes in the scuffle, so he peered at her through it like a lion in the grass. With each step, his graceful, rolling gait reminded her of a predator stalking its prey. Despite the forest floor littered in twigs and leaves, he didn’t make a sound.

“Wh-who are you?” Elia stammered, backing away, her hands up. He met her step for step until she came up hard against the tree behind her—and didn’t stop until he loomed over her, so broad his shoulders and chest made a wall in front of her. She could feel the heat rising off his skin in the cool, night air.

“I am the Leonine King.” His voice was a dark, husky gravel. Behind him a chorus of wheezes, howls, and chirps of agreement rose from the people watching. “And you are?”

“Elia,” she breathed.

“Elia,” he growled, leaning in closer, bringing with him the scent of pine and rain and the musk of something distinctly male. “I am Reth.” He said the name with a strange, guttural roll in his throat. “I am the King of Beasts. I am Clan Leader, and I am Alpha of WildWood.” Several snarls rose from the crowds behind him then, but he ignored them.

Elia swallowed as he leaned in until the scruff on his jaw rasped her cheek. “I am the King,” he said, “And you will be my mate.”

The forest behind him erupted.

******

Elia is a poor university student until the night she's taken to the world of the Anima—ruled by humans whose ancient hearts pulse with the blood of animals. There she's forced into a battle to the death. But when Elia survives, and refuses to kill her final opponent, the King must either kill Elia himself, or take her as his mate.

Reth, the brutal King of the Beasts with the blood of lions, shocks everyone when he chooses the weak, human Elia to become his Queen. He promises her every comfort of his wealth and position—but he is clear: She will not warm his bed. He chose her to defeat those that were trying to corner him into blending his Leonine line with the Wolves.

Elia needs the help of the Anima to become stronger and rule them well. But the vengeful Wolves see only a weak human that brought them shame. As Elia and Reth grow closer, the wolves are determined to destroy her. Will Reth and Elia admit their feelings for each in time to fight for the Kingdom—and their lives—against the villainous wolf-tribe? Or will the wolves kill Elia and steal the throne?

Like every pitiful protagonist, Xueyue's life was riddled with unfortunate events.


An aloof birth mother? Check.
A crazy father? Check.
An older sister with a superior complex?Double-check!


Through a twist of unfortunate events, Xueyue was sentenced to death by beating. And no, she did not reincarnate to a better life.

Offered the opportunity to have a new identity, Xueyue eventually found herself colliding paths with a mischievous and fearsome, but devilishly handsome Commander who'd stop at nothing to acquire her heart.

Will he succeed in doing so?

Sly. Vicious. Ruthless. The very whisper of his name was enough for soldiers to abandon their weapon and armor in the battlefield. Yet, this merciless Commander found himself on wits-end with a sharp-tongued woman that turned his entire world into beautiful chaos.


Many say love is a fleeting emotion, but to them, love is a constant devotion.

She was a daughter of the general’s family and a gentle woman. She fell for Prince Ding and offered to be his wife. After supporting him for six years, she became his empress.
After risking being a hostage in a foreign country, she returned five years later to find that she no longer had a place in his imperial harem. Lying in his arms, the new consort said with a sneer, “Sis, now that the country is stable, it’s time for you to die.”
Her daughter died a tragic death and her son was removed as crown prince. The Shen family had been loyal, but they ended up being slaughtered.
Shen Miao never thought that their marriage and mutual support all this while would end up being just an act Prince Ding put on! Prince Ding said, “On account that you’ve been with me for twenty years, I’ll allow you to die with your entire body intact. Now you may thank me and hang yourself to death.”
Before she hung herself, Shen Miao made a resentful oath, “When I perish, I will haunt you day and night!”
She was reborn as her fourteen year old self when the tragedies had yet to occur and her family was still intact. She was still the delicate and elegant daughter of a general’s family.
Her relatives were evil, her cousin sisters were vicious and ruthless, and her aunties were eyeing her possessions. She had to protect her family, take revenge, and get back what belonged to her. In this life, she would be the last one standing!
However, the Xie family’s young marquis, an unruly youth, pushed her up against the wall and said arrogantly, “Remember, the world belongs to you, and you belong to me!”
The thirteen cities of You State… belong to you.
The city of Dingyuan in Mobei… belongs to you.
Yuzhou by the Yangtze River, the East Sea of Dingxi, the Green Lake of Lin’an, and Luoyang City… they all belong to you.
If they all belong to me, what will you take, Xie Jingxing?
Hmm… you.
At first, he said impassively, “There has always been a clear distinction between the Shen and Xie family. For the Shen family’s daughter to suddenly show us goodwill, she must have ill intentions!”
Then, he said calmly, “We're all on the same boat. Shen Miao, behave yourself. Who would have the audacity to force you into a marriage while I’m around?”
After that, he said proudly, “Overthrowing an empire isn’t that hard. My dear, how shall we divide this great piece of land?”
Finally, he waved his hand domineeringly. “Sweetheart, dividing them is too much work. Forget it! They’re all yours, and you are mine!”

Author's Review After Writing 2000 Chapters

This story is a slow burn, perhaps as slow as the entirety of Volume 1. The main character is still a young boy and makes mistakes along the way. However, if you can push through to the second volume, you'll discover how this narrative managed to stay in the top 20 trending web novels for three years.

Here are some key aspects you'll encounter:

MC: The protagonist follows the classic weak-to-strong arc. Fortunately, he's supported by many loyal friends who help compensate for his weaknesses.

World: Picture a blend of Harry Potter and Star Wars.

System: While it's primarily a magic-based story, there's a structured system in place that's easy to follow. Additionally, elements of cultivation.

Harem: No, there are many female characters. But I enjoy romance first. So even if there will be more than one love interest it will be deep.

Note: English is not my first language, but you'll notice that my writing and English skills gradually improve throughout the chapters.

Other: The novel delves into deep research on science and history, enriching the storyline with factual and intriguing details. Give it a try—you might be pleasantly surprised by what unfolds.","2,097",10.4M,564,4.55,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/18131953005387705?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1715094889567

Well, now back to the synopsis.
...............
.
Chu Yi dies in a car crash and becomes Landon Barn, the illegitimate son of king Barn, ruler of Arcadina. Because his mother was a maid and the king’s greatest disgrace, his father had always despised him. The same could be said for his half-siblings.

**Note from the author**
1. This is a slow burn for FL and ML
2. Trigger warnings all around. Abuse, trauma, gaslighting and manipulation. These themes are present all throughout the book in different ways.
3. This book is not just about the FL and ML, the cast of characters and side characters are full of rich backstories and their own chapters that play into the central plot of the story.
4. FL is young, she is flawed and she WILL piss you off. We all need time and experience to grow up.

Chapter 69 is the first smut chapter.

UPDATE December 2, 2021:
I have provided a summary for Chapters 1 - 37 as I'm starting to rewrite them. It can be found in the Auxiliary Volume. Please give this novel another chance. I want to redeem myself as an author.

UPDATE January 19, 2022:
I already wrote the sequel for this novel called, ""Lewd Cultivation System"". The connection will be mentioned in the future, but for now, the connection isn't obvious. It can be read without prior knowledge about Combat Maid Harem.

UPDATE February 11, 2022:
For reasons I do not know, this book got nominated for WSA 2021, which is a huge success for this book. Basically, it means that this book is good enough but not good enough to get the gold, silver, or bronze places.

UPDATE October 3, 2023:
I've decided to pause this novel. I will end it when I have the time. For now, I'll go resume ""Lewd Cultivation System""

Was it possible for the devil to get his own happy ending?

A major accident seven years ago had stolen He Juan’s memory away from him, wiping it so clean that the only things he were left with were only his name, numerous scars all over his body and a nasty side effect as a result of the aftermath.

Seven years passed by and when He Juan thought he could live like a normal person again, a fateful day led him to be the prime suspect of the murder case of his neighbor who had written his name as her dying message — whom, in his defense, he had not even talked to!

It was then that he met Mu Yuze, the lone wolf of the Violent Crime Investigation Unit; the cold, intimidating man with beautiful and intense midnight blue eyes who seemed to hate him at first sight for some reason He Juan couldn’t comprehend.

One after another, bizarre cases intruded on He Juan's normal life and turned it upside down, bringing light to a dusty past he thought he could never remember again. In the end, he had to learn that even if he had forgotten who he once was… there were still some sins he had to atone.

And what is he going to do when he stumbles across the girl that fate has chosen for him and he finds out she has no wolf?

""This cannot be!"" I roared. ""There is no way that I can mate with a girl that does not even have a wolf. She will be too weak. She will be inferior. She will not be strong enough to be a Luna.""

And neither of them can make that mate bond go away. What are they going to do now that they're literally stuck with each other?

21283601205813505,Games,Gods' Impact Online,NoWoRRyMaN,"[WPC #220 - Gold Place Winner!]

In the future timeline, Humankind had developed things that brought a revolution to the world. But their best invention was fully immersive VR games that became more and more advanced as time passed. They could create new worlds— in virtual reality, that were more beautiful and profound than the real world they lived in.

Upon seeing how Humankind started discarding the world created by the gods and embracing the fake world created by humans, the gods were enraged.

Thus, gods transmigrated the souls of all the VR game players into the game created by gods—called Gods' impact, which was unlike any VR game. It was too surreal with daily struggles, quests, systems, monsters, and... more deadly and cruel than the real world.

However, they could use their real-life skills and talents in the game. They could use the real world money into the game. As they evolved in the game, their body also changed in real life. Furthermore, the players who died in the game also died in the real world.

How will Zach, who just happened to try out the VR game for the first time, only to be transported into Gods’ impact, survive?

""Everyone's stats are limited. I will become limitless by cultivating infinite MP!"" Zach announced nonchalantly when he realized he might be the strongest player in the game.

Little did the gods know that they would regret messing with Zach, and his existence alone would become a threat to them.
---
Note- Video games, fantasy, and realistic logic are applied in this Gods' Impact. But don't forget that the sole purpose of this game was for gods to screw over humans in every way possible.

Elise had about to change into the dress that was lying on the corner of her bed when she heard a knock lightly calling from her door. Curious, she turned the door knob only to have a tall man towering in front of her.

“Master Ian!” She called.

Ian smiled with the usual mischievous smirk that he always used. His crimson eyes trailing a little over her room and spotted the black dress over her bed and shifted his eyes over to the woman in front of him. He stepped forward and spoke. “Where did you acquire that dress?”

“Mr. Harland gave it to me.” Elise replied and strained her neck to see Ian’s brows knitted in its elegance.

“Do you know why a man would love to give a woman a dress?” He gave the riddle that she always had to think twice before replying. But this time, she found no answer and instead shook her head. “I don’t know.”

His grin grew bewitching as though something had stirred deep inside the scarlet eyes that he had. He slowly slid his hand over the collar of her dress, sending a cold shiver that startled her for a moment due to its freezing temperature. After unbuttoning the first two buttons on her collar, he tilted his head down, whispering to her ears. “Because they want to be the one to undress the cloth.”

He paused and kissed her neck, turning the pale skin to red before retracting his move to fix his eyes on her and leisurely replied. “Unfortunately, you can’t wear the dress over there with this.” He chuckled and passed a box over to her hand. “And the fortunate news is I prepared a dress for you.”



Elise was a cursed little girl who could see ghosts. Her family hated her and threw her from one adoptive family to another. However, misfortune didn't act alone. When she was brought up by her aunt, she was sold as a slave. When she had thought she would become nothing but a sacrifice to the sorcerer, she was saved by a man whose identity was far different than a normal mythical being.

- - - - -

In every love story, there's always a vengeful and venomous fiancée who was engaged to the rich and handsome CEO that fell for the poor, but gentle and innocent female lead. In his greed for her love, he broke his poor fiancée whose love drove her to the brink of insanity.

No one ever cared about how the fiancée felt.

Zhao Lifei was prepped her entire life to marry one man, but suddenly, his heart was captured by another. She was face-slapped, destroyed, and disowned for loving Zheng Tianyi. She was willing to sacrifice her youth, time, and heart for the man, but all she got was pain and despair.

It took two harsh, but awakening years for Zhao Lifei to finally understand the mistakes she has made in the past.

After her redemption, it was now Zhao Lifei's turn to experience a love grander than the female lead.

Smarter, feistier, and wittier, Zhao Lifei knew how to survive the cruel, backstabbing, and harsh upper-class society was.

""A cheating fiancé that broke my heart? Screw him, I'll find someone richer!""

""All of my friends have abandoned me? Whatever, I'll find better ones!""

""My parents disowned me? That's fine, my grandfather is wealthier and more powerful than both of them combined!""

To the polar opposite of the snarky Zhao Lifei, was the incredibly wealthy and powerful, yet ruthlessly cold Yang Feng.

Yang Feng, the King of the Business Empire, was a man to be feared. Heart of ice, eyes of stone, merciless but enticingly handsome, there was not a single person in this world that dared to offend him.

Many have tried, but none had succeeded in garnering his attention. That is, until his path unexpectedly collides with Zhao Lifei.

Challenges will arise, chaos will commence, and drama will ensue. But then again, what is a love story without disturbance? They say love without conflict is just a simple crush and the story of Zhao Lifei and Yang Feng was anything but that.

i will admit that during that time, I am still a young budding author and could have expressed the story better in the early hundred chapters. But I assure you the story development is worth it.

In his drunken state, Tristan could still absorb her words.

Tristan: ""Hey, my Zhen-Zhen. You will be my wife, right?""
Zhen-Zhen: ""Yes…""
Tristan: ""Then... make me happy. Come closer… and kiss me.""

She leaned closer to Tristan as she pressed her delicate warm lips into his cold lips.

Zhen-Zhen: ""Are you happy now, Tristan?""

Tristan shook his head and pouted.

""No! Zhen-Zhen, that one could not be considered as a kiss! You just pressed your lips into mine."" He complained to her exasperatedly.
“Come here, I’ll teach you!” Tristan held her face then he began to kiss her passionately.

Tristan pulled her head closer as he deepened the kiss. After a few seconds, Zhen-Zhen responded and returned his kiss with equal intensity as his.
'Damn, she's a fast learner.'

I would never marry you if I knew that your sister was the one who saved me.” Yun Xi was dumbstruck. It was actually her who saved Mo Ran! She struggled to look at her sister, Yun Lian to see what was going on. Yet, what she saw made her heart sink into her stomach. Yun Lian lowered her gaze as she said, “Sister, I’m sorry. My Brother-in-law and I truly love each other. I’ve been hiding this for so long now, and I can’t hide it any longer.”
Yun Xi suddenly felt her world spin, and the past flashed through her head. Her sister had always asked her about how she saved Mo Ran in detail and constantly stood between her and Mo Ran. He gradually became more distant from her - was that all for the sake of today?
Yun Xi and Yun Lian are twins, but because Yun Xi was always been better in her studies and had a better husband, both society and their parents showed their bias toward Yun Xi. However, Yun Xi would always tolerate and dote on Yun Lian, giving Yun Lian most of her opportunities, including the precious chance to go to school. Staring at her husband’s icy expression, Yun Xi dragged her sickly body to the window and jumped down.
When she opened her eyes, Yun Xi realized that she was not dead. Instead, she had returned to that summer day when she was competing with Yun Lian for an opportunity to go to school. It was on this day that Yun Xi offered her most precious opportunity! Now that she was given another chance at life, Yun Xi swore to take back what was hers. Whatever Yun Lian took from her, she would have Yun Lian pay everything back! As for her ex-husband, Mo Ran, Yun Xi decided to let Yun Lian have him. Yun Xi did not want him anymore.

21105271105223805,Urban,The Substitute Madam Amazes the World Once More,,"Mo Zhu's mother remarried after her father went missing, and she had lived in the countryside with her elderly grandmother ever since. The girl who had no parents wanted to protect herself. Therefore, to avoid getting bullied, she had turned wild since she was a child—she played truant, fought, and drank. There was nothing she did not know how to do. She was a problematic student in the eyes of her teachers, a big sister in the eyes of her classmates, and a hooligan in the eyes of her acquaintances.
When she was eighteen, her birth mother retrieved her to live at her stepfather's house. Everyone in the village claimed that she was going to live a happy life in the city, that her mother had not forgotten that she had a daughter here. ""Mo Zhu, the Huo family is one of the most powerful families in the country. It's your good fortune to replace your younger sister in marrying into the Huo family. You have to cherish this opportunity,"" explained her mother patiently as she held Mo Zhu's hand. Mo Zhu's eyes were filled with sorrow. At that instant, she knew why her mother thought of her. Inviting her over to the city to enjoy life was simply a figment of her imagination—she was simply an exploitable piece of trash that her mother could sacrifice.
The Eldest Young Master of the Huo family fell severely ill recently. He did not just develop a twisted personality, but also became violent and cruel. His face had been completely ruined and he had only two years left to live. Mo Zhu's younger sister was supposed to be Eldest Young Master Huo's fiancée, but the ruined young master was no longer a suitable match. Fearing the Huo family's influences, her mother did not dare to cancel the marriage, thus she sent Mo Zhu under the bus to protect her younger sister. However, was Mo Zhu truly just a useless simpleton who knew how to smoke, drink, and fight? No! That was simply a disguise she used for self-defense since she was a girl without parents.
After marrying into the Huo family, she stopped smoking, drinking, and fighting. She became the best daughter-in-law a mother-in-law could ever have; the best wife a husband could ever have. What never occurred to anyone was she no longer flunked in her studies. In fact, she transformed into a straight-A student. Half a year later, she enrolled in the best university in the country and majored in specialized medicine. Determined to become an excellent doctor, she cured her husband's illness completely in merely two years. That handsome and suave Eldest Young Master Huo returned.
After Huo Xuan's recovery, he allocated a huge budget and held the biggest wedding of the century for Mo Zhu. During the grand wedding ceremony, Huo Xuan announced during his speech, ""In this lifetime, there are two people I'm most grateful for other than my parents. One of them is my mother-in-law. Thank you for despising me after I fell ill and forcing my wife to marry me in her younger sister's stead. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have met the most important person in my life! The second person must be my wife! She never despised me when I was at my lowest. Instead, she takes good care of me. She's an angel sent by God, and she has saved me with her forgiveness and kindness, granting me a second chance at life.""",,,12,4.36,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/21105271105223805?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1631158040677

A boy devastated by the loss of his family turned to games to fill the void.

The game he chose was a Virtual Reality Role Playing Game where you could seduce and have passionate erotic scene's with the heroines, as it was rated 18+

On his first day before playing the game, he chose to use a preset of a character with a similar name to his, ""Lucian Von Silver,"" a vampire baron but a sub-villain in the game's standard route, only surviving properly.

However, this route would see him lose his beloved childhood friend because of his useless talent and playboy lifestyle.

When choosing this, Lucian thought nothing could go wrong with making a custom avatar that looked like the perfect mix of the two.

When he entered the game, a strange figure appeared above his home, apologising as lightning struck down on his house.

Lucian was electrocuted inside his VR pod and died without starting the game.

Yet this was unknown to Lucian, who awakened in a luxurious nobles' room.

Slightly confused, he decided to keep playing, only to discover he now inhabited the body of the actual baron, ""Lucian Von Silver!""

But this was not the game, but a real world that the game was based on.

He began to feel dread at the thought of the future until he gained the system that would guide him.

""The Seduction System""

This was the first step in his becoming one of the most lustful and powerful vampires in the entire universe.

It was only a tutorial and a means to smoothly transition the primitive species from thinking that they were alone in the entire universe, to being integrated into the true wide universe.

When the average user level in the game exceeded the predetermined threshold the tutorial finally ended and planet earth underwent a catastrophic event called the 'First Awakening ', as mana started to flow freely in the real world as it did in the virtual world and the real universal stage game called 'Sigma' was unveiled.

'Sigma' was governed by the omnipotent A.I. the universal queen, and was the grand stage where races from all across the universe fought together for territory, resources, and honor.

Set in a universe where fantasy races such as elves, dragons, and vampires are not a myth but real power players, humans quickly found out that they were one of the weakest races to play 'Sigma'.

In such desperate times, humans turned to their best professional players for salvation.

Max, was a genius in the world of Omega and deemed the hope of mankind after the first awakening. However, an accident crippled his mana veins and caused him to be assessed as a manaless trash in Sigma!

Deemed hopeless and irredeemable, he quickly went from hero to zero, and the world ignored him.

For ten years since the first awakening, he lived the life of a manaless trash and became a bottom feeder in society, slowly losing his pride, his possessions, and eventually his identity.

In the end, he faced a tragic and painful death while failing to save his young nephew and niece from assailants.

However, it was not the end of Max's story but just the beginning as he was reincarnated back in time to the day before the first awakening before his downfall started!

As she explores the world she finds that it is somehow both modern and old, with magic permeating every day life. Architecture reminiscent of the 1700s clashes with modern day conveniences enabled through magic.


Will Shaman be able to make use of her knowledge of video games and novels to take advantage of her rpg system in this new world? Or will she be dragged down and entangled by the darkness of the world around her as she searches for the truth behind her circumstances? Many eyes are upon her as she takes center stage in this new world.

Throughout their three years of marriage, Wallace had never slept with Sharon. His family also kept persuading him to divorce Sharon.

It was the birthday party of the Harris family's old matriarch, and all youngsters of the Harris family had given the most expensive gifts possible to make the old lady happy—everyone but Sharon. She asked to borrow money from Madam Harris for the old housekeeper, Uncle Smith, as he had no money to pay for his medical treatment. But as expected, the Harris family humiliated her when she requested.

""The Harris family has never had a poor relative like you. Don't you ever appear in front of me again! Wallace should've married Crystal. She's certainly a young lady who's worthy of marrying into our family!"" said Madam Harris.

""Please know your place and get out of here. Don't stay at our house anymore. How can Wallace's grandfather be so foolish to marry a poor, useless woman like you to my son?!"" said June, Wallace's mother.

""It's just a few million dollars, yet you're so poor that you need to borrow from our family. How can a woman like you deserve to be with Wallace? If it were Crystal, she definitely wouldn't have embarrassed us so much!""

That night, Wallace handed Sharon a bank card, which contained millions of dollars. ""The company is developing, so I don't have much cash. You can use this to help Uncle Smith.""

Facing the Harris family's hostility, Wallace stated, ""Since I have married her, she is my responsibility. Regardless of her being rich or poor, Sharon is my wife.""

It wasn't until a stranger approached Sharon one day. Only then did Sharon know that she was the daughter of a top prestigious family, who was eligible to receive assets worth at least ten billion.

She suddenly owned the largest company in New York and a bank card that contained hundreds of millions of 'pocket money.'

--------------------------------------------------------

Greetings, dear readers! As the author of this book, I would like to take a moment to talk about its structure and pacing.
When I first started writing this story, I was still learning the craft of writing and exploring the world and characters I had created.
As a result, the first volume of this book may feel a little slow-paced at times, as I took my time to introduce the setting, the plot, and the main characters.

However, as I gained more experience and feedback from readers like you, I realized that I could improve the pacing and make the story more engaging and exciting.

Therefore, I have been constantly revising and editing the chapters, trying to find ways to streamline the exposition, increase the tension, and deepen the character development.

You may notice some differences between the original and current versions if you have read the first volume already. Some scenes may have been cut or shortened, while others may have been expanded or rearranged.
However, I want to assure you that the core of the story remains the same and that the characters and themes will continue to evolve and surprise you.

The last issue I would like to address is the portrayal of the main character (MC) on this website. I have noticed that on average, on this website, there are two types of MCs:

1) The ruthless, apathetic, or cold MC
2) The normal or intelligent MC

The problem with both types is that they often become godlike or fighting experts within just five chapters. Not only is this unrealistic, but it can also become monotonous, in my opinion. It seems that many authors tend to use these two types frequently. That is why I have created a completely different main character for my story.

In this story, the MC is flawed and has faced many challenges in life. Unlike other characters who are already ahead, the MC finds himself starting from nothing. He learns to fight, interact with people, and manage difficult situations. This means that he won't always make the same choices or take the same path as you would. It's important to remember that every person would react differently in each situation, and there is no universal answer for how to handle every circumstance. Please keep this in mind when you come across moments where you may not agree with the MC's actions and consider his unique perspective and way of thinking.

However, he committed a grave blunder by taking the fiction he had read as a reference. Reborn as a baby, he hoped to be deemed gifted by speaking early.

One thing led to another, and tragedy struck. The villagers declared him a demon-possessed and called the church. Johnathan, now known as Sylvester Maximilian, realized that he had messed up.

When the church's inquisitors came to judge him and burn him on a pyre. As a last resort and to welcome his soon to arrive second death, he started chanting holy hymns as his last breath.

Overwhelmed, they kneeled, thinking he was a messenger of Solis.

From there, the story of how Sylvester Maximilian rose through the ranks to sit at the top began.

But his life won't be ordinary, as he uses his cunning and the tag of 'God's favored' to his advantage. Fighting treachery, unearthing secret plots and world mysteries, facing the darkness around him and creating his place in history, engraving his name in the annals to be forever remembered as the—Immortal Pope, The Young.

[A/N: To not mislead you, the novel's name does not mean he instantly becomes the Pope from the start. The story will follow the life of MC. Though he will become the Pope at a pretty young age. 40% of the novel will be based around MC fighting to sit on the supreme throne.

24908760405236305,Fantasy,God of Crime: Strongest Mafia Boss,HIKARU_GENJI,"The gods exist. The Supernatural is real.

But poor foolish Mortals can never pierce through the Truth hidden by the Veil.

They say Ignorance is Bliss. But for Adam, such Bliss woven by a lie is worthless.

In his opinion, Ignorance may be Bliss but --- Knowledge is power.

This was the truest fact; something Adam built his empire around.

----

He wasn’t always this rich. He wasn’t always this powerful. There was a time he too struggled to earn enough for the treatment of his sick and dying mother.

But one day, on a Halloween night, his life was forever changed.

His eyes were opened to a completely new Reality.

The truth that was hidden from the eyes of all normal humans.

An entirely different world, rules, and society exist just in front of us.

Follow Adam, as he uncovers the Truth about his identity, the power in his blood, and his adventures as he rises to the throne that is rightfully his.

To attain his goal, he will not hesitate. He will even become the God of Crime if that is necessary.

---------

The story will be moderately slow-paced during the First four volumes as I set Adam in the world and slowly develop the world-building and Adam starts to adapt to the new reality.

I know it might not be to the taste of everyone, but I believe it's worth it.

We discover the world together with Adam and how he will grow from someone who knew absolutely nothing about the supernatural world to being someone no one can ignore.

This will be a long road and I would be happy if you are willing to walk this road with me.

And at the heart of it, all was Luan Dimas, a man who had lived for a thousand years and had amassed an arsenal of techniques.

With his knowledge and skill, Luan would have to fight his way through the chaos and overcome any obstacles in his path. The fate of the world hung in the balance, and Luan was determined to come out on top, no matter what it took.

She wanted to cry.

The man's voice turned cold as he struggled to control his emotions. ""So, you're telling me that you don't want to be my wife? Why? Didn't you want this to happen?""

As the Crown Prince and future Emperor, Zheng Liang was used to being pursued by nobles and aristocrats who were eager to marry their daughters to him. So why did this woman, who was already engaged to him, want to break it off? He wanted to dissolve this arranged political marriage as well, but he hated it when she brought up this matter.

Was she insane, or was she mocking him? Perhaps she had a new scheme to gain his attention.


Because there is no way she will want to break off this marriage. She was a power-hungry and scheming woman who would do anything to gain more influence. There was no way she would willingly give up her position as a member of the Royal Family.

Yang Ning noticed the man's suspicious and disdainful expression, but she remained polite and answered with a smile, ""Your Highness, the reason is simple. I don't want to be a sacrificial lamb.""

She scowled inwardly, wishing she could just break off the engagement and be done with it. ‘What is his problem? Just break the marriage alliance and be done with it. Didn’t you hate me? Now I am giving you a chance; Just call it off!’

The Crown Prince was confused by her cryptic words. Was she trying to manipulate him by her confusing words?

She gave a fake smile, but inside, she was crying. She knew that marrying this man would mean putting her life on the line. Who in their right mind would willingly offer their neck on a silver platter?

Not her!

She refused to be a villain in someone else's story. Instead, she was determined to take control of her own fate.

With her beauty that was enchantingly demure and a wise mind, she had caught a lot of attention and captured the hearts of many. One of them was the dashing crown prince of the Maganti Empire.

Overcome by the desire to have her and his interest in the land of the small kingdom, the crown prince of the said empire would stop at nothing. The knights from the Maganti Empire marched across the masses and seized the four-hundred-year-old kingdom of Rikhill.

The kingdom of Rikhill fell into ruin overnight. The crown prince left no members of the royal family alive aside from his war trophy, Aries. After suffering in his hands, Aries found the perfect chance to escape.

That was when he took her to the world summit. A gathering of each sovereign from each kingdom and empire for peace talks.

There, she met the emperor of Haimirich, Eustass Silvestri Abel Bloodworth. Overwhelm by desperation, Aries begged him to take her in. It was too late when she realized that the man she asked for help was far more cruel, twisted, and downright diabolical than the crown prince for taking her as his… pet!

EXCERPT:

With a pair of crimson eyes hovering over her, Aries held her breath. When the corner of his lips curled up devilishly, she couldn’t react fast as he swiftly flipped their position. She only realized it when she was saddling him, gazing down at Abel, wide-eyed.

“No one is above me in this empire and even out — not even the law, but look at you,” he intoned with a devilish smirk. “Staring down on me… so daunting.”

Aries bit her lip, planting her palm on her inked chest. “Your Majesty…”

“Do you now understand the power you hold, darling?” Abel carefully wrapped his fingers around her wrist, chuffed by her reaction. “Only you, Aries, may go above me and the only person in this world who can look down on me. No one else.”

He raised an arm and ran his fingers through the side of her hair, settling his palm on the back of her head before he pulled her down until her face was a palm length away from him.

“You better use this at your own disposal,” he whispered, tilting his head as he lifted it up to claim what’s his. HER.

Meet Eustass Silvestri Abel Bloodworth, the sadistic tyrant, who reigned an empire with an iron fist. With his pet, Aries’ increasing presence in his boring, dark life, he was set to kill her. But alas, every time he thought of taking her life, he finds himself changing his mind.

The more he kept her by his side, the more it got harder to dispose of her. And the more he yearned for something deeper and darker... it was driving him insane.

With a secret he was keeping from her, what would Abel do if Aries found out about the rotting truth behind the empire and the emperor? Would he kill her? Or kiss her? Perhaps cage her?

And if she found out that Abel wasn’t just a normal human, would she try to escape? Or would she accept that he wasn’t just a demon incarnate?

In a complicated world that tainted them black, was love even possible to bloom between a pet and her master? Watch as these two play the dangerous and insane game of love and lust.

Who would be the master and the pet? Who was the prey? Read to find out more.

Reset: New World

°°°°°
Alexander Kael Touch, a self-made young billionaire, found his meteoric rise tragically cut short on a school trip. But fate had other plans, whisking him and his classmates away to a realm of swords and magic – a world where power manifested as unique: ''Gifts.""

While friends awoke to magnificent Gifts, Alex's Gift yielded only two enigmatic guns: one gleaming silver, the other shrouded in black.

Worse, he couldn't use magic like his peers, drawing scorn and derision. Yet, fueled by an unyielding spirit and a burning dream, Alex refused to falter.

In this new world, he craved not wealth, but the strength to forge his own destiny. One goal burned bright: to rise once more, not to the peaks of financial power, but to the pinnacle of strength and control.

This is the chronicle of Alexander Kael Touch, the boy with two guns in a world of wonders. A tale of relentless struggle, forged in the crucible of mockery and doubt. A journey to the apex, where the scorned student will become the ultimate warrior.

Whispers of the ""Death Guns Master"" stir, echoes of a legend rising from slumber. The world may have forgotten them, but they are coming back.

Nickaido's here with D-Guns, do not expect the smartest MC because he was once a billionaire, is still young, he has his flaws, he will learn and grow, so will the other characters. At the beginning other characters are stronger but worry not everything will change starting from around chapter 80 onward. Also sorry in advance because some of the female characters have strong backgrounds but it's for the sake of the future story, this book is just the start, I'm still improving.

Sorry in advance, English is not my first language, so they may be grammatical errors and misspelled words. Please bear with me. I'm trying to improve to provide a better story.

Starting from chapter 200th, I have started using Grammarly premium to help me with the English, so I think it's become better. As for the earliest chapters, I have started to re-edit them slowly; I will do more as I get more time. Maybe hire a professional editor when I can.

Once again, this is not some sophisticated story; it has many flaws, which I'm trying to learn from; however, this doesn't make the story less enjoyable. Would you please give it a try?

Good News: I reincarnated!

Bad News: I reincarnated inside my favorite novel!!!

You are asking me why this is bad news?

That is because...

In this world, even the main cast was going to die halfway through the story!

The only character who won't die no matter what was the protagonist.

And of course, I wasn't the protagonist.

Nor was I the character who had a special background to make you think of him as a hidden protagonist.

The crown prince was cursed on the day he was born, that he will never be happy. What's worse, no woman could touch him without dying. Thus, finding a wife to produce an heir became the royal family's greatest challenge since the prince is the only son.

Until one day.. a servant girl who tried to kill him didn't end up dying after they touched. Emmelyn was a princess from one of their colonies who vowed to avenge her family's death by killing the crown prince. And that's how she ended up in his castle.

Seeing that she was the only woman he could have a sexual relationship with, without killing her, the prince made an agreement to let her go and free her kingdom from his oppression if she produced for him three heirs.

Emmelyn said yes, but every day that they were together, she made plans to kill him and get her revenge.

Can Emmelyn get what she wanted, or would she be entangled deeper with the enemy who was deemed as the devil incarnate himself by his enemies?

EXCERPT:
""You will be the mother of my children,"" said the man in a commanding tone. His shameless words rendered Emmelyn speechless and shocked, more so, than the kiss he landed on her lips earlier. ""I need three children from you.""

""Eh ... wait.. what? Hold on a minute,"" Emmelyn, who was moved from her shock, hurriedly rubbed her lips roughly as if trying to remove the devil's marks from them. ""I don't want to be your wife! I don't want to marry you, you devil!!""

The man frowned and squinted his eyes menacingly. ""Who said anything about marriage?""

THE NEXT DAY
""Let's go,"" said the prince.

Notes:

Side Stories in ""My Cute (Yandere) Disciples' Side Stories""

If you're here for the R18 tag expecting adult scenes, know that this was a decision I made quite late into writing this so the scenes only come up very late into the story.

One or more of the disciples may or may not have a tragic (depending on personal opinions) backstory that may or may not offend/disturb some readers (depending on your personal opinions/mental fortitude/openmindedness/morality/sexual orientation/real world knowledge/political agendas/reaction if someone gave you lemons/view on whether the Earth is flat or round, which I personally think it's neither and is actually a donut nom nom nom) which may or may not affect the rest of the story significantly. Consider yourself sufficiently warned.

“Why do you think we will help?” Kace asked while narrowing his black obsidian eyes, his wolf took control of him. He was the youngest among the three and the less temperamental among them.

The three of them were cursed by Selene because of their ferocious action to gain supreme power and authority.

The moon goddess didn’t bless them with a mate as a punishment of their atrocious way and forced them to involve in this deadly war with the demons.

“You will turn us into a slave for those sickly creatures!?” Torak asked incredulously. “Aren’t you afraid that we will snap them into two?”

The guardian angel was so fragile and they as lycanthropes didn’t appreciate the weaknesses.

“No, you will not.” Selene said patiently. “You will not be their slave nor hurt them, you will cherish them in every way possible.”

Jedrek laughed menacingly upon hearing this, they didn’t care about the resurrected of the beast, once they crossed their territory, with or without the guardian angel he would tear their body apart. “I will be the last person they will see, once I find them.” He was referring to both the guardian angel and the demon.

But, the next voice from Selene was laced with mirth when she spoke.

“You will not hurt your mate.”

Now, at twenty-seven, Lily Qin was an established businesswoman who was single-handedly controlling her multinational company abroad. She was beautiful, smart, and successful. Women envied her while men couldn’t help but worship her ethereal beauty.


With her devastating past, everyone had assumed that Lily would exact revenge on the people who had wronged her. Who would have guessed that behind that beaming smile of hers was a numb heart that aimed only to make more profit?

""You got it wrong."" Lily elegantly propped her chin on the back of her hand. ""I am seeing you today because we have something in common. We're both villains in somebody else's eyes. And I think it's time for us villains to get our own happy ending. Don't you think so?""


---


Zhuo Jingren’s love for Lily Qin was something that only he knew. Ever since they were children, he had his eyes on her. Yet, every time he had tried to confess, he would end up fainting from nervousness.


So when Lily Qin promised to marry him if he became richer than her, Zhou Jingren did not hesitate to leave the orphanage and work his way up just to become her man.


Who would have thought that years later, when he was successful and feared by many, he would come back to an engaged Lily Qin?


Then she mistook him for an escort after eating his tofu? Preposterous!


The worst thing was, she seemed to have forgotten everything about him. Hadn’t she promised to marry him the moment he became more prominent than her family? Now, after taking advantage of him, she dared to run away?

This woman was a liar!

He gritted his teeth as he watched her approach him. He was about to say something mean when she suddenly spoke. “Are you my new bodyguard?” She did not even wait for him to answer before tossing her car keys at him. “Drive. Let’s go wreak some havoc.”


Thus, the mafia’s big boss became Lily Qin’s bodyguard.


---


""So? What do you want as a compensation?"" Zhuo Jingren asked her once again before laying down next to her. His elbow was resting on the ground and his palm was supporting his head as he looked at her intently. 

The first thing that Lily noticed about Zhuo Jingren when he laid next to her was his exposed tanned chest. This made him look more casual… and hot. She didn't even realize she was staring at the latter.

""Why are you staring at me like that?"" He smirked at her. ""Do you want me to compensate you with my body?""

Lily immediately rolled her eyes at the latter. ""Who wants your body? Hmp! I want money!""

""Your mind is always thinking of money but your body actually betrays you. Am I right to say that I have a shameless wife?""

""Hah! I am a strong and independent woman of the 21st century. I know what I want. But if you insist on giving your body, I will take it too!"" Lily shamelessly said, taking off her stilettos. However, just when Lily was about to lie down beside Zhuo Jingren, he suddenly pulled her on top of him. With her body on top of his, their faces were really close and they could even feel each other's breath. 

""What a shameless woman,"" he noted, the smile on his face only deepened.

“I know what you want Chloe, you want my money after we divorced. You want to take everything from me and I will not let that happen!” Vincent accused.
“I don't need your Money, Vincent! I just want to take Mackenzie with me and leave!”

At last, she left her bastard husband without taking a cent from him. She was going to carve her own path in life and give her daughter the best in the world.

She contacted her brother-in-law— Vernon Phoenix Gray, 25, a young, heartless playboy, who happened to be the CEO of a skyrocketing company, asking him for a job in this tough time.

“A job? That's not an issue. You can work as my personal assistant and take care of all my daily needs.” Vernon smirked and leaned in. “Especially in bed,” he whispered in her ear.

23117951906253905,Fantasy,Void Evolution System,Crocs_is_Dead,"5 years ago, Earth was subject to an event now known as the “World Awakening”.

At that time, the world completely changed. Mana awakened in the world, gates began opening, and a holographic screen showed up in front of the eyes of every human that outlined their “status”.

Each individual was given a talent to start with, ranging from simple abilities like enhanced eyesight to insane fantasy stuff like pyrokinesis.

And within this myriad of abilities, Damien awakened a spatial affinity with the skill “short-distance teleportation”.

At first, he was excited, thinking about intense battles and gaining great power, but the reality was quick to shoot him down.

His ability only worked in the area 10 meters around himself, and his physical stats were insanely weak, leaving him tired after using his ability a couple of times.

Disillusioned by his weakness, Damien lived a quiet life doing anything he could to meet ends meet, until one day, everything changed.

Damien was betrayed and thrown into a gate, left to fend for himself in a labyrinth of beasts.

Something snapped in him that day. He refused to stay weak and keep his head down any longer.

When he emerged from the darkness, he found himself in a new world with no idea how to return to earth.

However, he wasn’t the same kid he was when he first fell.

22679332106970805,Urban,Not your typical baby mama,Miabella265,"All Amy needed to do was get away from her pursuers. The last thing she thought she'd encounter was being kidnapped, drugged and offered to some smelly fat old man.

But no, he wasn't any of that. Zach was simply a god. And he was drugged, just like her. It could be the drugs or she just genuinely found him irresistible. And to her luck, he didn't resist her when she made a move on him. When she found out how much of a beast he was in bed, she wasn't complaining.

But she knew they were not supposed to cross paths. So when she finally left the next morning, little did she know that fate had a 'little surprise' in store.

“If you’re sensible, you’ll find a quiet place to die on your own, instead of tarnishing our people’s glory.

“You’re just an ugly toad. Stay in the mud quietly, and don’t burden our pack.”

On Benson’s nineteenth birthday, he found out that we were destined mates. But I didn’t expect that he would rather endure great pain than accept me. Every word he said smashed directly into my heart, and the pain made me tremble uncontrollably.

I learned I wasn’t my parents’ biological child when I was sixteen. Although they thought of me as an angel that a stork had given them, it didn’t change the fact that I was a weak, little human.

I was just a soft egg who would fall over with a poke, a loser who couldn’t even see the road without help from the moonlight. My existence brought shame to my parents, and to my pack!

Perhaps I should have died in the woods from the start. With that thought in mind, I decided to return them a pure and unblemished pack tonight.

So, I jumped off a cliff and thought I would die. I never imagined I would be saved, and my true identity turned out to be the Lycan King’s only daughter who had been lost eighteen years ago. I was also heir to the throne!

That surprised me a lot. I was actually a werewolf? But… Why was I so weak? Was this all just a mistake?

To become a qualified heir, I concealed my identity and received training. However, could that frivolous instructor who was in charge of training me really help me awaken my wolf, or was he simply taking advantage of me?

As I grew stronger and became a public figure, others attacked and plotted against me many times. Did they have anything to do with those who kidnapped me all those years ago?

She even took home three golden actress awards at her coming-of-age ceremony when she was eighteen years old. Her life seemed so beautiful and filled with applause. However, behind that beautiful scene was a grave filled with lice. Since she was three years old, her family had treated her as their cash cow. Her parents’ wickedness caused her reputation to rapidly plummet when she was eighteen years old. What was more terrifying was that they even imprisoned her. They drugged her, beat her, used her younger sister as a threat against her, and turned her into a plaything for wealthy businessmen. Ding Shan endured the humiliation for her sister’s sake, then finally sent those beasts to prison two years later. Just as she thought she could finally clean up and live a good life with her sister, reality slapped her in the face. “Why?” Ding Shan asked her sister from where she was tied to a familiar iron bed.“No reason, really. I just hate you, so I drugged you two years ago. I’m the one who pushed you into hell. I’m also the one who posted that viral video which exposed you back then,” Ding Yuan said as she happily inspected her red nails.“Oh, by the way, you’re not my real sister either. My parents kidnapped you from some ravine. Your parents chased after you, but my father pushed them off a cliff and they died. I can’t really remember since it happened so long ago. Plus, I only heard about it occasionally, so I can’t remember the details anymore.“Also, you’re tied up here today because your boyfriend, Wen Xiu, sold you for 10 million. You’re still worth a lot of money, so you should perform well tonight. Ding Yuan reached out to pat Ding Shan’s face, then injected her with an aphrodisiac. The fiery burn that coursed through her body made Ding Shan weak, but the hatred in her heart kept her mind clear and awake. Drugged and left unsupervised, she ended her life with a knife she found in the room. As her life came to an end, Ding Shan swore that if she could start over, she would make all those who had wronged her pay all that they owed her.

This was exactly how I felt the day I died.

I was the love child of the Eclipse Alpha King, in a time where the mate bond was considered sacred, a child born out of wedlock was nothing short of sacrilegious...

'It was his fault, he loved someone other than his mate...'

'It was his fault, he had carnal knowledge of a human woman.'

'It was all his fault, my only crime was being born out of his lust.'

But why was that Alpha King father of mine perfectly safe, while I was hated, scorned and blamed for everything instead?

Why did I have to be my father's bargaining chip, used to achieve his goals?

Why could I not get a rejection like everyone else but was instead murdered by my own mate?

Why was I killed before I even had a chance to live?

I had a thousand questions and yet there was no one to answer and this was exactly how I died...

So why then did my eyes flutter open to that day, a month before my death?

Was it because of my little secret?

A secret I will tell no one else but you...

From the title of my tale, you must think I am an omega wolf...

No, you got it wrong... I am not an Omega wolf, I am an Alpha wolf and my name is Omega.

Should she pretend to faint? That was the only thought that made sense. So that was what she did.

Alicia wanted them to take her out of there and then she would find a way to escape. But maybe she was unlucky after all, because when she peeped under her lashes, wondering why no one was coming to carry her out, she saw a golden robe, before the person crouched down in front of her.

She shut her eyes tightly and stilled her breath. She was an actress, after all. She could pull this off flawlessly.

Scary.

His voice wasn't really threatening, but somehow he commanded fear, especially with the slow and careful way he spoke. She had heard he was bad-tempered. What would he do after the three seconds passed? Would he kill her? Then would she die here? How did he even know she was pretending? Were people in the middle ages usually smart?

Valerio Avalanzo was a wealthy European man who was betrayed by his lover, leaving him in a condition that he very well hid from the entire world.
 
The incident caused him to drastically change. He became cold-hearted, feared by most, unsociable, emotionless, and, worst of all, developed a deep hatred for the word ""love.""
 
For a man who was blind and held such deep hatred for love, it was believed that he was emotionally incapable of loving anyone, therefore leaving the world with this perception of him.
 
But what happens when he meets Everly Eloise, his caregiver?
 
Will his heart win, or will his hatred for love win? And what happens when he discovers that Everly is not just his caregiver but a werewolf as well? The creatures that have been an enemy of his kind for centuries?

And, was their encounter decided by fate or maybe it's a given chance? A chance given to each of their hearts to heal?

18761925005900305,Eastern,Journey of the Fate Destroying Emperor,LazySageDao,"After being reincarnated in a world of Gods, Demons, and Great Emperors, Wang Wei embarks on a journey to bear Heaven Mandate, proves the Dao, and proclaims himself a Great Emperor--a Supreme Being that overlooked Myriad World and Races. However, his Dao involves despising fate and its encompassing glory. So what awaits our protagonist on his journey full of vicissitudes to defy and even control fate? While he controls the fate of countless races and worlds, is fate playing with him? Can he escape the very shackles of fate that he controls?

Better Synopsys:
After an unknown cosmic accident that enveloped the Earth, Wang Wei was reincarnated into a magical world of spiritual cultivation. This world was composed of powerful Demons, cunning and brutal Devils, ruthless and indifferent Gods, detached and ethereal Immortals. More Importantly, Great Emperors--Supreme Beings that stand above everyone and everything, even life and death itself.

Despite being born in one of the most powerful sects in the world, Wang Wei was placed under tremendous pressure when so many expectations were placed on him by his sect due to the fact they have not cultivated a Great Emperor for countless millennia--an act which threatened the fundamental status of his family, friends, and sect.

On top of that, Wang Wei was not one of the chosen few of this world that was granted special gifts by Heaven, thus further aggravating his circumstances.

However, he did not retreat in the face of adversity.

With the mindset that “If Heaven does not give me, I shall take it for myself”, Wang Wei begins to plan his rise to the top with a brilliant tactical mind and the help of his mysterious soul so that one day he will become a Great Emperor that not only control his fate but the fate of all lives in existence.


This story has a similar setting as Emperor Dominion, I am a True Villain, and Scoring the Sacred Body of the Ancients from the Get-go. If you enjoy this type of story, then you will enjoy my story.

As he breathes his last, he hears the echoes of mechanical voices resonating in his head, granting him a multitude of wishes in the form of Skills, Fortunes, and a new Body.

Reborn as an Ice Dragon, Drake finds himself thrust into a fantastical realm reminiscent of Norse Mythology known as Yggdrasil. This world, however, holds more surprises than he could have ever imagined. It is not only a realm of fantasy but also a Cultivation World, blending two seemingly disparate concepts into one.

Join him on his journey as he explores this enchanting world, navigating its treacherous landscapes and encountering deadly monsters along the way. As he fights for survival, he seeks to find his place in this new existence and discover the purpose that drives him forward.

Yet, he soon realizes that he is not alone in this reincarnated state. Others have been granted wishes as well, and the collision of their desires threatens to plunge the world into utter chaos.

This is a tale of rebirth and transformation—a man's evolution from a humble Dragon Pup to the indomitable Strongest Dragon King. Along his path, he will forge new alliances, face formidable foes, and gradually establish a place he can truly call home.","1,723",7.1M,65,4.73,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/20194068905822805?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1713378327168

ryuxenji the translator here. :3 Here are some other things you should know:

1) This story is NOT primarily a romance. QI's system right now categorizes all novels taken from the female novel Chinese site (起点女生网) as 'romance' without fail, regardless of whether they truly are romance. So, if you are here just for the romance, you might want to find a different novel. There will be some romance eventually, but most of this novel is Sci-Fi/Xianxia with a lot of world-building and character development.

2) I use British spelling. So, please ensure spelling errors are really errors before reporting them.

3) No matter what the release rate up top says, the guaranteed release rate right now is 1 chp/day (a.k.a. 7 chps/week). All else is extra at my discretion.

In the year 3000, humanity was forced to leave the Earth when a sudden mutation caused more than 70% of the planet's population to mutate either into zombies, werewolves or vampires. The humans put up a fight but didn't have a chance against the united front of the monsters, and they were forced to leave. At least those who were rich and lucky enough to leave.

A century later, the chaos on earth had calmed down, but the humans who were left behind were treated like slaves and were forced to join one of the three factions: The Undead, The Cold Ones or The Lycans when they turned 16.

It was a similar story for Ashton, who was one week away from being turned into one of the monsters as it was his 16th birthday. He decided to run away from his fate and join the secret resistance to battle against the monsters.

However, his plans came to a standstill when a series of misfortunes led him to be bitten by a Zombie, a Vampire and a werewolf before either of his powers could manifest.

He ended up receiving all of their powers but at the cost of his humanity. Yet, he wasn't willing to let his humanity die. No matter the cost.

Will he be able to live his life, or is it already too late? Which faction will he join? Will he be able to find the secret behind the mutation?

There were too many questions, and only one way to find the answers: follow Ashton's journey as he fights back to retain his humanity.

Everything seemed amazing but was it true or just an illusion?

______________________________

[Things to be noted]

1. From the title, you should've guessed it already but let me tell you the story will be filled with many sexual adventures. So... you are welcome to enjoy them.....

2. However... don't expect MC to have sexual relations with every woman he meets. I'll be focusing on the story, and would 'Try' not to blindly throw sex scenes left and right.

3. Most importantly, this is my first time writing so the the quality of first 50 or so may be a bit lacking (But it would cause you no problem if a few minor errors don't bother you).

4. It is a slow paced story. If you want everything to be explosive and fast, maybe this isn't for you.

Important Note: If you enjoy the story then don't forget to
vote your GTs, Power stones and also if you can, send some GIFTS too. This poor soul would appreciate it.

Also check out My other work: [ Rise of the Strongest War God ] & [ My perverted devil system ]

24448342606794305,General,The Ninth Sister is a Prodigious Beast Master,,"Memories surged like a tide into her head after she was reincarnated, and she found out who she was... A complete pushover. Her name was Beiting Huang, a direct descendant and third-generation descendant of the Beiting Dynasty. Her fearsome reputation stretched across all nations on the continent. She was a girl, but she was disguised as a boy for some reason. Everyone was also after her wrist... to hack it off and take the bracelet she wore, which was actually a high-level spiritual item that concealed her gender.
Everyone included her own brothers. Her brothers were fighting and killing each other, tearing the dynasty apart in the process... and she happened to be caught in the crossfire.
Mercy? Did the old Beiting Huang not beg before she died? Did they spare her when she did? An emotion that was not hers stirred within her body, and Beiting Huang knew it was the old Beiting Huang's grief.
In her mind, she assured her: Don't worry. Since I've reincarnated in your body, I shall avenge you. Your death will not be senseless! After those words, the old Beiting Huang's emotions faded.
Now, there was only one Beiting Huang. She was the underworld's king, a mercenary lord who slaughtered and plundered with the world at her feet. Reincarnated into the fearsome Beiting family as its 'useless’ ninth son, the world's riches were once again in her grasp. She cultivated impossible abilities, contracted with magical beasts, and possessed a mystical dimension. She also trampled over gods and demons as and when she liked. Cold and handsome, her very presence was proud and magnificent, causing the world to fight for her affection.",,,89,4.2,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/24448342606794305?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600&imageId=1664530382094

When she wakes up again, she is an ordinary third year student in high school. Due to her ignoble past and the ostracization of her relatives, she has always been bullied by her classmates, partly due to her being a loner.

With her gaining a new lease of life, she undergoes a massive change, returning any bullying she received in the past. With a powerful cheat, a pair of telepathic jade eyes, she is able to easily appraise jade and succeed at gambling.

She starts a business, becoming a legendary businesswoman. There's no need to talk about people who previously mocked her for being poor when they see her billion-yuan net worth. When relatives visit to cozy up with her, they are denied. We are no longer related to one another. Return to whatever foul place you came from!

Just that, he acts like an entirely different person now.

She settles on a master plan. Lose weight first, make money, get a divorce, settle the people who killed her, and find a way to go back to her brother.

But wait...why is this cold and unapproachable husband acting like a white lotus? What is she going to do with her plans if this stunning husband refuses to let her go?

...

""I want a divorce,"" She indifferently said.
""Fine,"" the man coldly responded without any shift in his expression.

One month later:
""When are we getting divorced?"" She asked calmly, not wanting to deal with a moody husband anymore.

She just wanted to be done with her revenge first, then find her brother and live a carefree life like before.

His gaze darkened, ""The procedure is going on.""

Three months later:
""Jun Zixuan, where the heck is our divorce paper?!"" She finally lost her patience and snapped at him.

If she could use any three words to describe herself, Jiang Yue would say that she is rich, beautiful, and extremely smart. Unfortunately, she took these for granted in her past life, causing her downfall.

After reincarnating to her fifteen year old self, Jiang Yue wants only three things: to build an empire, spend more time with the people who love her and live a happy life.

...

In his past life, he was unable to express his love for Jiang Yue.

Now that he has reincarnated, all he wants to do is show Jiang Yue how much he loves her.

If she wants only three things, then he wants only three things: to build an empire for her, to spend more time with her, and live a happy life with her.

Mixed with a little hint of mind-boggling mysteries and secrets, what happens when two reincarnated individuals meet and fall in love?

""Do you believe in reincarnation?"" Fu Jin's question instantly made Jiang Yue froze. She remembered how she was the one who asked this question when they first met.

""Of course I do."" She answered. She was the living proof that reincarnation existed. ""Why are you asking that?""

""Well... if I tell you that I reincarnated just to make you mine, would you believe me?"" His question immediately gave Jiang Yue goosebumps.

She did not answer him, instead, she turned around so she could face him.

Their gazes met.

""Then if you were given a chance to reincarnate, would you find me again and make me yours?"" She asked.

""Of course."" He answered, as he tucked a loose strand of her hair behind her ear. ""I would find you and wait for you Mrs. Fu. Even if it would have taken million years and million lifetimes.""

Fu Jin's answer instantly made Jiang Yue smile. However, this time, a mysterious light flashed in her eyes.

Maybe, Fu Jin's words were true.

Maybe, he also reincarnated just like her.

And maybe... just maybe, their souls were already connected, long before they reincarnated.

“From now on, assassins sent by my enemies would target Nero,” the emperor explained. “Until he’s strong enough to protect himself, you’ll pose as your twin brother.”
Her smile froze, but she still acted innocent. “But Father. If I take my brother’s position, then wouldn’t the assassins mistake me for him and…”
She stopped talking when she realized that was exactly what the emperor wanted her to do.
[This sc*mbag wants me to be bait?!]

A smooth sailing second life of Athan starts with something mystical inside his body and other benefits of it that could make him stronger with some suffering. However...he didn't know that due to his soul ( That was supposed to return to the source of the universe after death but instead, it transmigrated by someone for some purpose and that caused an adverse effect like increasing misfortune on his soul ) The benefits he receives ultimately becomes the source of his second doom that is even worse than death. But...that's when the future Void emperor is born.

However, what if the first place you appear is inside a coffin?

This is what Qin Yuan experienced.

While he had boundless strength, he was already at the end of his age so he had to seal his body.

The only thing he could do was to leave with a Spiritual Body whose strength was extremely limited.

The good thing is that there is a system that suddenly appears.

On one side, there was a group of technologically advanced humans. But, on the other, a world of cultivation had grown and pospered.

The secrets that led to this change have been hidden in the darkness for too long... Until there came a day where a boy born on the Mortal side of the world was found to have the talent to enter the Martial side. Having lost both of his parents to a hidden tide, he chose to leave all that he had known behind and enter this land of danger.

What truths would he unveil? What would he learn about what separated the Mortals from the Cultivators? What hidden evils wanted to ensure that his people never rose up and gained power? And how would those evils... deal with him?

This list of things I hate is quite long.

The first is that I hate to be tested the most.

The second is that I hate to be tested the most.

The third also happens to be that I hate to be tested the most.

The ocean's depths are too shallow, the sun's light too dim, the ground too mundane and the skies too small. For those born of this colorless world to deem themselves worthy of casting judgement on me... I can only say that it's laughable.

I am the Nameless Immortal God because even the Heavens themselves are unworthy to name me. Even while I am unaware of my own identity, I will dry the oceans until cracked land is all that is left, I will cast the sun into endless darkness, I will shatter the ground with my feet and sunder the skies with my blade.

Am I too arrogant? What right do you have to think that?

Her celebrity crush was kneeling right in front of her and asking her to be his wife? Was he mistaking her for someone? Was it possible this was a skit, or maybe this was like one of those celebrity pranks, and there were cameras around, waiting to capture her make a fool of herself? Or perhaps she was dreaming? Sonia wondered as she looked around them, but all she saw were curious onlookers.

""Please! Be my wife and make me the happiest man on Earth,"" He said in a very loud voice that caught the attention of everyone.

Her editor who she had been waiting on for over an hour because he was trying to sign a deal with a movie producer who was interested in one of her stories, showed up at that moment, ""Sonia, you know Bryan Hank?"" Her editor asked in genuine surprise as he watched the scene before him. It seemed like an hour had passed since Bryan went on his knees, but it had only been a minute.

Bryan knew no lady would be crazy enough to accept such a crazy proposal, and even if any were, paying her off and calling off the whole thing would be easy since all he wanted was the scandal that could come from this. The headlines were either going to be about his rejected Marriage proposal or his supposed engagement, which would be enough to let Sophia off the hook.

""Yes!"" Sonia said as she bobbed her head excitedly and extended her finger for him to wear her the ring.

""Yes?"" Bryan asked in confusion when he heard her response.

""Yes! I will be your wife and make you the happiest man in the world!"" Sonia said with a giggle and wiggled her fingers until Bryan slid the ring down her finger. Surprisingly the ring was her exact size, and it sat on her finger like it was made just for her. The sound of applause erupted all around them as Sonia stood up with a big smile on her face and embraced Bryan before kissing him right on the lips.

Bryan was slightly taken aback by her boldness but quickly recovered since this was his game, and he had to play along. He was the one who had approached her first, after all. So when she tried to break the kiss, he held her chin and slowly nibbled on her lower lip before parting her lips with his tongue and sucked on it in a teasing manner, eliciting a moan from Sonia.

Sonia felt light-headed. This was too good to be true. It just had to be a dream. How else could she explain that one moment she was seated at the lobby of a hotel waiting for her editor, and the next she was engaged to her celebrity crush and was kissing him right here in the open?

It would mean a lot to me if you could read it and give your valuable review. Thanks in advance.

****
The novel follows the story of Arnold, a porter, who accompanies warriors and superhumans inside dangerous dungeons, which are distinguished by their colours. The porters were always mistreated by the modern human civilization and even though their job was riskier than that of warriors and superhumans, their existence was never appreciated nor were they paid well.

No one knows why these dungeons started to appear all over the world. The only thing they know was the dangers that would find their way into the world if they didn't kill the monsters. But only a selected few cared about the calamity because for the rest it was all about earning money and gaining power.

But nothing in this new world is constant and everything keeps changing, and this time the change would find its way towards an ordinary Porter.

After stealing a scroll from the dungeon, he ran off to his home. The scroll gave him powers no one could've imagined to gain. But he wasn't alone. 9 other humans had been granted similar powers... powers of the Gods!

What would Arnold do with his newfound powers? Will he kill the other 8 Paladins and rule over the world which had oppressed him for years? Or will he rise against the Gods and make them repent for their crimes?

Can the strength lent by the Gods be sufficient to deal with them once and for all? Would he be able to defeat his creator? Or will he join the Gods instead?

Too many questions, too little time. The decisions he would make could be the end of humanity Or would an ordinary Porter, become he world's only hope?

Follow me on the journey to the power of this ordinary Porter as he becomes the Savior or the Devil.

Warning:
There might be a few grammatical errors in the early chapters, so if you are a grammar nazI then please proceed with caution.

Also, the MC isn't very bright and will do a lot of stupid things from time to time. So if you like a cool and calculating MC you won't be seeing him like that until later chapters (Chapter 100 or so). I'm telling this to y'all here so you don't start yelling at me in the comments or review. All in all, I've tried to make the MC as realistic as I could.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you and enjoy reading my creation!

Using his knowledge from the future, Xiaomao invested in the VRMMO game early to prepare for the new age - The Age of Superhuman and Cultivators. He would soon find himself integrating with his in-game character to awaken his superpower and become one of the superhumans.

Me, Fractures, Bonet, Mono-socket, Broadbone and the gang.

Then from nowhere, that ungrateful sockethole, Somanda tries to END me! Can you believe that?!

I mean, I have told some questionable stories about him caressing my skull affectionately and deeming me his prized undead, but no need to axe a skeleton for something like that, right?

RIGHT?!

I managed to escape through one of the most convenient and contrived get-aways in all of undead history, even managing to pull a bony one on the Lich bastard by stealing two of his seemingly important possessions which I find out later to be better than I thought they’d be!

From there it’s a just a SPIRAL of boneshit left and right! I can’t catch a break! What’s with this atrocious luck, bro?!

A voice speaks to me about how I have qualified for something about a something that’s supposedly something’s something!

Then I find myself in a new world that reeks of life and gives my bones a disgusted rattle.

Powerful beasts and men are at every turn, all lining up to be a huge pain in my PELVIS!

GAAAAH!

Jeez this is happening too fast!

However, even while I’m in the thick of this, the one saving grace is that I got something worth while!

A new path of power!

I can NOT be an undead!

I can be something better than both the Living and the Dead!

Immune to the antics from both sides. Well... most of them!

I’m no longer on the path for Undeath!

Only Lifelessness awaits me!

[Author’s Answers To Popular Readers’ Questions]

Q: (IHateArjuun77) -Hey author, is your book trash?-

A: (Author) -Haha, screw you dear reader. The answer is NO. The story has elements of comedy, action, magic, adventure and Brutality. Like it gets really dark sometimes. There’s a comprehensive story with characters that I tried my damndest to NOT make generic on top of a cool power system that’s for the most part easy to understand. So its not trash.

Q: (IFreakingHateArjuun56) -Hey author why is your first volume so slow paced and... trash?-

A: (Author) -Haha. It’s how I designed the First Volume to be. It’s a fun setup that doesn’t focus on many things other than the MC’s mentality, powers and route of progression. The next volumes are normal paced, focusing on the world, the villains and general expansion but all while still retaining the book theme and fun experience-

Q: (ShadeIsAPervert001) -Hey author, I instinctively sense that I’ll hate this book, when should I drop?

A: (Author) -Is this the same reader?! Anyway, I’ll give a range. Read a minimum of the first 20 chapters to a max of up to chapter 44 before you decide on anything too rash. I’ll hunt down this reader!

In the Heart’s Kingdom, a kingdom where vampires reign and humans were nothing but livestock, Lilou, a peasant, found herself being preyed upon by the worst maniacal vampire of his kind. However, as terrifying as what he addressed her as his ‘reserved meal’, this vampire also called her his bride!

Except:

My eyes brood with fear, gazing at the still-beating heart in his hand. “My Lord, pardon me but… is this the bloody proof you promised to show me?” I asked, my voice shook as I gulped down whilst struggling my trembling knees from giving away.

“Mhm… do you now believe I’m good at capturing hearts?” The silver-haired man, bearing those menacing pair of deep crimson eyes stared proudly at me after a nod. I gasped when he clenched his hand and squeezed the fresh heart to smithereens.

“Yes, milord. You’re good at it, literally.” I’m mortified, watching the pieces of the heart fall as he approached. His every step made me take a step back until my back reached a solid pillar.

“Huh,” Samael chuckled briefly, stopping in front of me. His long, pointy nails that were covered with blood traced my elbow down to my hand. Gently, he clipped my forefinger in between his, guiding it before his lips. “Did I pass your test, though?” He asked, the sharp tip of his nail playing over the tip of my finger.

I stared at his penetrating gaze as I reluctantly answered, “Barely.”

He smirked, nodding in satisfaction before he pressed his nail on the tip of my forefinger that was quick to produce a drop of blood. “Such sweet aroma.” He whispered, placing my bleeding finger in his mouth and licking it with passion.

His menacing gaze never left mine as he consumed a bit of my blood. “Does that mean you’re accepting my invitation?"" Keeping my finger in between his fangs, Samael inquired.

I bit my lower lip unconsciously, my heart within my chest drummed as my back broke into sweats. “But… I’m just…” I paused, hoping my answer would put an end to this. “… I’m just a human.”

Samael clicked his tongue, displeased at my response as he let my finger go. “No,” He whispered.

My entire body stiffened when he bent over, caressing my shoulder up to my neck by the apex of his nose, as his hot breaths prickled my skin.

""You're not just a mere human... you are my human."" He stressed before I sensed his lips part and the tip of his fangs against my skin.

If an item only had a 0.1% chance of dropping, then it would be 99.9% for him instead.
When he mutated the True Eyes, he got the Eye of Truth, another cheat-like power that not only allowed him to see the hidden stats, but also the information of items.

But mistakes would eventually be corrected one day. When the real daughter of the family returned and her foster parents begged her to stay, she obliged. Unbeknownst to her, this was actually a scheme disguised as familial affection. They only kept her around to squeeze her dry of all her value!
One day, Lin Yun woke up and found herself and her future brother-in-law in a compromising position in a hotel room. She was about to escape but reporters aggressively pressed her for answers. In the face of their interrogation, Lin Yun could only respond with a pale face. Yet, her childhood friend, and now brother-in-law heartlessly accused her of setting him up while her sister, whom she had doted on for four years slapped her hard. Her former mother complained disdainfully to the reporters about her ‘despicable actions’ and announced severing ties with Lin Yun.
The consecutive betrayals traumatized Lin Yun. Before she could clear her name, she was killed in an accident. Just before she died, she learned the truth… that this was all a scheme by her sister, the real heiress. Since the beginning, the Lin family only saw her as an item… All her love and affection turned into resentment the instant she died.

However, ideals never go as planned, and the man became attached to her after waking up.

Nathan has a deep resentment against Phantomflake as she was the one who assassinated the most precious person in his life. He wanted revenge!

And things just got more exciting when a magical creature appeared in front of Phantom's soul, giving her a ridiculous mission in exchange of regaining her body back.

""Make him fall in love with you within 100 days!"" The flying creature said, pointing his small paws at Nathan who expressionlessly stood next to her sickbed.

With her eyes going round, Phantomflake made an 'you-got-to-be-kidding-me' face at the flying creature.

No way! That's a mission impossible! This guy loathed her so much. How would she do that??!

Excerpt:

Nathan grabbed her by her neck. ""Don't play tricks with me, Phantomflake."" Nathan's cold voice reverberated inside the room, his eyes burning with rage.

But Phantomflake just smirked at him, pressing her hands against his chest, her fingers teasing him. ""You can't kill me, Nate. Just admit it. You've already fallen for me.""

With one swift move, Phantomflake pulled his shirt, closing their gaps as she crushed her lips against his lips. Surprisingly, Nathan just found himself responding to her. He lost! He couldn't resist her.

Many died and even more turned into zombies, starting what many would call 'The apocalypse Era'.

Her goal from this was simple, trample on all the protagonists and become the strongest creature in that world for a chance to get back what he thought he lost forever.

Accompanied by a cold beauty, both of them embark on a new journey to become stronger, get back to their world and fix everything.

My take on the isekai genre, so it's nothing new idea-wise. But, I wanted to make a serious, fun, and thrilling story out of the ordinary isekai you see everywhere.


It will be heavy on romance, action, and some smut here and there for the cultured weebs. Don't expect a full-on smut book though since that's not what I want to do.


The first 4 chapters are the prologue to set the tone for the book, it is crucial but you can skip it if you don't like slightly sad stuff. It will build the two main characters (Rin and Elise) well as a start.


Anyway, support the book and add it to your library as help for this poor soul :)


(also, for those interested, I just dropped my newest book. Its name is 'Supreme Warlock'. It's very different from SM but I hope it will be enjoyable for you.)

“En. Can’t you see how our good looking genes are passed on to our children? As for the Feng family’s debt, I will pay you.” He said nonchalantly.

Tang Moyu scoffed and crossed her arms over her chest.

“How will you pay for it?”

“How about I repay you with my body?”

“...”

So shameless!

The man sitting on his wheelchair burst into a round of laughter seeing her ugly expression.

“Miss Tang, it’s no point pretending you haven’t seen it since you practically climbed on my bed and took advantage of me.”

Five years ago, Tang Moyu was the empress of the business world and was at the peak of her career before she was reduced to nothing when her fiance fell in love with another woman. That was okay since there was no love between her and Feng Tianhua, but who would have thought that this ‘Cinderella’ was a wolf in sheep’s clothing?

Then there’s Feng Tianyi, the infamous successor of the Feng family, a critically acclaimed author who constantly rocked the bestselling list with his books. Rumors say that he was hot-headed and temperamental. He was so ruthless, that neither men nor women wanted his company. The rumors even say that his face was so handsome and out of this world. He was practically a god amongst men. It was a pity that he was crippled.

The two were never meant to meet again, but a pair of sweet little buns intervened.

“Uncle, we don’t have money to pay you for damages.” The elder Little Bun said.

“My manuscripts are invaluable,” This handsome uncle replied with amusement.

“Uncle, if you don’t mind, can we pay with our Mommy? She’s also invaluable.”

And so the pair of sweet little buns and the handsome uncle entered an agreement but who would have thought that the woman in question was an ice-cold queen from hell who had a weird affinity with sweets?

Demons terrorized the world ever since the Gehenna Realm descended over 300 years ago. but along with them, came mana, giving birth to witches to combat these demons.

Since then, the world of men was dominated by witches, establishing the seven witch kingdoms, which safeguards at the forefront of the demon invasion.

In order to survive in the matriarchal society of the witch kingdoms, Vaan, like all other men who cannot use magic, had to learn how to service the witches to survive.

Nevertheless, it did not come without its own benefits.

Years of research have led the world to the discovery of intimacy between men and women could increase the witches' mana absorption.

But at the same time, men could absorb some of this mana to improve their physique and lifespan.

Thus, since then, an intricate relationship was formed between men and witches in the red-light districts. Love became casual, and dual cultivation is common.

As a prodigy in the art of pleasing women, Vaan lived a smooth two years since his transmigration as an orphan.

However, everything came crashing down in a heartbeat one day when his life was nearly taken, and Lady Eniwse whom he served went berserk.

Even so, that was not the end.

Lucien was more than ready to embark in his new adventure to save a dying world from destruction as part of the Heaven's Gate Project.

However, just as he was about to be sent to the world that he was about to save, an accident happened, which forced his Patron God, the God of Gamblers, to take another gamble in order to preserve his chosen candidate's life.

Lucien, who's new identity was named Lux, found himself in a world where darkness could be light, and light could be dark. A world where morality was but a thin line from depravity, and a happy ending could only be gained, by facing the world and slapping it with a Legion of the Undying.

Check out the book, leave a review after reading, and also your powerstones. Hope you enjoy this, and Thanks for reading ^_^

P.S: When I started this book I had zero writing experience, so the first chapters aren't that great, although, my writing quality has improved over time. Also, English isn't my first language, so there are some instances where my choice of words are not good enough for what I'm trying to portray. A heads up, the book will be using a medieval setting. My world building is not the best, but it gets better over time, so bear with me on the early chapters!
